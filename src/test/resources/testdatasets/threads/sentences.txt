Why do we question?
Why aren't we happily contending ourselves with eating, shitting, sleeping and fucking like all the rest of our animal brethren? Why do we worry so much about stuff thats so incredibly far removed from matters of everyday survival? More precisely: how is it that we're even able to worry about mortgages or airplane safety or an unmowed lawn?
And don't hand-wave this away with "evolution, frontal cortex, tools". Other apes use tools as well. Them and dolphins might have something resembling culture, too. Birds use tools. Elephants. Fucking molluscs. Even cats and dogs can learn how to open doors on their own. Basically all of mankind's pets posess some form of intelligence, even inter-species social competence (excluding gold fish), language. That's why we chose them as companions, because they're not boring (excluding gold fish). And yet none of them have contributed anything of substance to the great tradition of philosophy on planet Earth (excluding g... no, wait). Why?
Either there's some qualitative difference in intellicence separating us from them that needs to be found (as in: pinpointed, epistemically, not just postulated) and explained, or we should listen a lot closer to the noises some of these guys make. And however that works out, there's still the question why higher intelligence emerged at all. Fungi don't seem to need it...
