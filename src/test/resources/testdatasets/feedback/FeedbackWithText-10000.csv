27853,"Nous n'avons pas apprécié que lecapitaine simule un appel téléphonique pour l'avertir que nous ne pouvions nous rendre sur l'ilot Gabriel (ni les autres iles d'ailleur). En discutant avec d'aures touristes dans la même situation que nous, ils nous ont dit avoir été prévenu avant le départ en leur donnant le choix de partir faire un tour en mer, ou de reporter leur excursion.",3

15,Fun. Informative. ,10
13804,Because the trip wasn't postponed due to bad weather. We couldnt see any island. The crew was nice but just to sit on a boat in a lagoon that's not what i wanted to do.,5
18904,The staff was very friendly & helpful. It was a lovely trip. The only issue was that we were sent am email the day before saying pick up point was at Bain boeuf but I called to confirm & was told by sunset boulevard cafe. But upon arrival I called Bruno who advised in was in fact grand baie beach! ,9

43765,A great tasting experience with an excellent and knowledgeable tour guide.,10
44008,Very informative and hands on. We got to see a couple of things you don’t normally get to see just because it happened to be going on while we there. Would recommend to anyone to visit and also go back myself. ,10
44178,We had a great time! We went to Beer School and then we were able to go on the free tour. When I called to ask about information I was told Beer School and the Free Tour were sort a 2 for 1 deal. I appreciate that and will definitely be back again someday. Thank you for the great time! We loved the sampling. ,10
44806,tapit,10
43383,The tour was a very informative and fun experience. My tour guide was very knowledgeable about the distillery and answered any questions we had. The tasting was also a great experience. Our guide and the girl who helped him both knew a lot about the spirits. Last thing the Lady who worked at the front (with the her dog Ray Ray) was incredibly nice and friendly and even watched my dog while we were taking the tour. ,10
58761,It was a great time for everyone.  The music and food was great!  The tour that we took was outstanding.,10

765,Fun time!,9
12426,"When I booked the tour said: Departure at 08:00 from Chania. Stop for coffee and visit of Agia Sofia's cave close to the village of Topolia. Visit of the beautiful monastery of Chrissoskalitissa and stay at the unique, sandy, rose, beach of Elafonissi, on the south-west area. Departure from Elafonissi at 15:00 towards Chania with small stop at a taverna for lunch.... Well we didn't stop at the monestary? That was the most disappointing and the main reason I would not book with you again....on the way back the driver hit the wall of a tunnel and shattered a glass window, someone was sick on the bus which smelt bad and the air con wasn't strong enough for the warm temperatures.",5
18411,"The tour was in 2 languages (German and English) which took double the time and was a very inefficient use of our time both at Knossos and the Archaeological museum. It was also distracting to listen to multiple languages on the bus, which initially caused us and others to buy the €15 ticket instead of the €16 (which seemed to irritate the tour guide).  We therefore had no time to walk around Heraklion as there was only enough time to eat lunch (there should have been sufficient time to both eat lunch and briefly walk around the city).  Furthermore, the need to buy tickets at Knossos wastes time and causes confusion and should have been included in the upfront price of the tour package.",5
43669,Our tour guide Tiffany was super fun and very knowledgeable. ,10
41488,It was very well thought out and Lyndsay was a great tour guide.  I would go again and definitely tell others.  ,8

43385,Out guide was friendly and knowledgeable. ,10
42587,"Great experience. Great seeing American Pharoah. Would have loved just to touch his cheek for one second. Not many I know enjoy horses that much, so would depend on their interest whether I recommend. ",8
43766,Something for the whole family!,10
44461,I've been on a number of horse tours and this was the best. Fun and very informative.,10
44651,"Great tour and guide. Loved the facility, architecture, sampling and small group",10
42928,"Briann, our tour guide, was great! She was knowledgeable and energetic. The tour was laid back and overall fantastic; we were able to see a couple of the stallions including Nyquist, Frosted, and Medaglia D'Oro. We also got to see the mares with their foals which was awesome. My husband and I thoroughly had a great time and would definitely return!",10
44891,Great experience. Cool staff. Nice environment ,8
19766,"We had an amazing day with Dmitris in Crete. Dmitris seems to know everyone in town. Everyone greets him warmly. He picked us up at our villa, and we began with a walking tour of Old Chania town, where we learned history, viewed the beautiful town and port, and, happy to customize the tour to our interests, took us to visit the tiny synagogue. Then we drove a scenic road to a small village and visited an olive oil mill and winery, where we had delicious wine tastings with snacks. Dmitris' son Yannis, also an excellent guide, was leading another group, and we all went out for a meal together at a beautiful restaurant with incredible views. GS Tours has many options, and will accommodate your requests. We loved the day, and felt that we made true friends with Dmitris and Yannis.  We all highly recommend them. ",10

144,Great tour.  Fun and informative ,10
29181,"Rum was fine, tour felt like a one hour commercial and I paid for my own ""samples""  ",5
29156,Great experience! Rumal was a wonderful host - so funny and charming. The only thing I would change is bigger pours! ;),9
29180,"We thought we would get more insights in the making of rum as we are actually on site (e.g. showing the distillation apprature etc.). Furthermore, tasting was very hasty with no chance to neutralise taste.",3
29700,Had a great time,9
29742,"The Tour Guide made the event fun and interesting, instead of reading from a script.",10
36781,"Our guide Rumal was very interesting, informative and funny. We enjoyed a great tour and tasting and were then encouraged to shop and have a cocktail. We purchased in the shop and had just ordered drinks at the bar as our tour transfer driver said it was time to go. Although we asked for a take away glass, the driver said no drinks in the vehicle and we had to leave or miss the transfer. We downed our drinks and left. A big shame that a great morning was far too rushed at the end with no leeway in departure options.",9
37875,This was a very good tour and was exactly what we expected.  It was nice to relax at the end of the tour and enjoy a favourite beverage.,10

44090,We had a great tour guide: Bubba!  Beautiful scenery and a nice tour and tasting! ,10
43982,A brilliant brewery tour. Thank you. ,10
39988,"It was a wonderful morning, our entire trip to St. Louis was one of best vacations ever. The guide was fun and knowledgeable. The only negative was the gift shop, I had a glass engraved and was told it would take 15-20 minutes. It was over an hour to complete, we would have ordered lunch immediately if we had known how long it was going take. It made the afternoon unnecessarily dragged out. ",10
42627,Celia was very knowledgable on the History and cuisine of the area. She was friendly and easy to get along with. ,10
38496,Tour guide was a little too wordy. Less opportunity to drink your good beer. Loved the anecdote story about the legend of Matilda however.,4
25998,"Our guide Anil was very professional, caring and customer orientated: > We lost time due to the festival. He managed to recover the time and put us back on track. > One of the porters got ill and had to leave. Anil carried part of the load himself.  > I did not have a day pack with me for the acclimatization walks. Luckily Anil was carrying one with him which I could use for the rest of the trek. > All the rooms at High Camp were booked, but Anil managed to arrange one.  > He arranged a bus for me from Mukthinath to Jomsom when i suffered from knee pain after descending 1600m the day before.  > Everybody made it over the pass without any big problems.   Although i did not use a porter, it was nice to have the porter Gonesch in the team. He was super friendly and caring.   The only thing that was unacceptable was the bus ride from Jomsom to Totapani. The organization must know this road is very bad and dangerous. During the bus ride the bus almost tipped over several times. A jeep ride would have been much more appropriate.  ",9
207,The tour guide was excellent and it was a very fun tour.,10
208,Sample sizes were adequate for the price of the tour. 1 full pour would've been perfect,9

43892,"Beautiful facility, amazing beer! ",10
43983,The product is incredible plus the staff was so friendly and accommodating. Lindsay made our tour so enjoyable. He was very knowledgeable!,10
44091,"Fun, informative and free beer samples!!",10
44808,It was just a great tour. We got to see pretty much all of the areas and the tour guide was very professional and spoke of things in medical terms not just lay terms. The facility was clean and no one acted like it was a bother to have us there. ,10
43674,"Absolutely loved the ""DayFresh"" (BudLight) tour.   Our guide, Kate, was extremely knowledgeable and handled every question given to her by our group.  Very in-depth, historic, and would do it again since there was so much info.  PS:  free beer ""samples"" were much bigger than I anticipated...Bonus :-)",10
44984,Always great,10
29500,"i have traveled in more than 50 countries in almost 30 years and i don't think i've experienced the same level of service.  we initially thought of just hiring a guide and porter and skip the package tour but, so glad we did the package with this company. first, i don't think the price difference is significant at all. i tried to do the math, i don't know how they made money from us. plus, when we needed refund from the airline to lukla, we didn't have to worry about calling the airline. he just handed us the cash back in usd. for travels like this where there are some uncertainties, especially if this is your first time to EBC or in the region, i would strongly advice on using this company.  advantages - chhatra will answer all your questions based on your needs and what fits you best and not on how he will make money from you - we needed to evacuate and we didn't have to worry about anything. he even stopped by the hospital to make sure everything is ok.  - chhatra worked as guide for years and he can give you all the possible options if everything doesnt work out according to your plans - emails are prompt, you can even text him or call him directly using the whatsapp app. - we get tshirts, caps and free duffle bags. the duffle bags were new and really strong. - very, very helpful and you will be confident on the trails if you know there is somebody you can rely on if your plans dont work perfectly.  - our guide, dhana was very, very patient with us as we are slow trekkers and have been to EBC at least 200 times so, he has all the knowledge that you need. our porter, raju was very strong and very nice. the two turns to carry my wife on a steep climb to namche bazaar when she got sick. amazing really  i might come back someday. eventhough i know i have a knowledge of how the system works now and i can think of doing it independently, i would still go with this outfitter. do the math, not really much difference but, your confidence level and peace of mind will be much highe",10
28824,I wasn’t sure about bringing our children as there looked to be no information on the website about bringing kids on the tour. When we arrived we were advised that we could take the kids but we couldn’t take our daughters buggy round due to stairs etc and if we’d be advised of that on the website I would have brought her carrier. I decided not to do the tour and stay with our daughter in the cafe everyone was lovely but I was alittle disappointed I couldn’t get a refund for not being able to go round the tour.,7
54788,"It was an interesting tour, but sometimes it felt a bit pushed and commercial. The guide felt stressed and spoke very quickly.",7
275,"Friendly and informative staff, a really nice afternoon at the small batch tour with my wife",10
38495,"I enjoyed the tour thoroughly, the one thing I might recommend(I don’t know the liability issues) is maybe a bit more personal touch. I enjoyed some of the other distilleries letting us get up close and personal with the process, tasting the fermenting stages of sweet to sour. Getting up close to the still, tasting or at least nosing the white dog. Where I thought the tour excelled was the history lesson behind the distillery, the ability to see the steps start to finish. Personally I also loved seeing that old rick house(oldest on the property). All in all it was a great experience, but felt a touch more sterilized than perhaps something’s we saw at Buffalo Trace, Jim Beam, and even Four Roses. Great tour and really neat state of the art equipment!",9
241,The history. The presentation. And the experience ,10
253,"The guide, Caleb, was very ""robotic"", talking too fast. This is a issue for tourists who do not speak English fluently.",7
258,Great tour and great service. ,10
38475,The tour was really informative and entertaining. Would definitely recommend it again. ,10
38627,"Jade Tours is well organized.  Juan,our guide on the Mangrove Tour was excellent.   He has great people skills, and his knowledge of of birds and the region was exceptional.   We had eight people onthe tour and he was able to spend time answering all of our questions.  ",10
42570,Thought Bo gave a fun tour and was very informative. More laid back approach than some of the others.  Nice to have the opportunity to meet Mr. Russell out front as well.,10
42591,"Very fun and informational, probably do it again!",10
29843,"Hello NEA Team, I have just returned from the Annapurna Circuit trekking tour. I would like to express again that I had an amazing time and experience throughout the whole tour. Our guide was Dorjee Sherpa with huge experience and knowledge. He gave us amazing support, much needed attention, free time (to take as many pictures as we wanted) and of course all the information about the trekking route or just generally about mountaineering. It was a small group of 2 (myself and a fellow trekker) and as we both had good fitness level we moved quite quickly. Dorjee and Chaatra were very helpful and flexible to proceed faster than the original itinerary. This gave us the opportunity to have 2 extra days. So we managed to spend an extra 1.5 days in Pokhara which was very nice and relaxing (only did a small hike to the Stupa) As a single, female traveler I can highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure and their trips as they will make you feel very comfortable and secure during the whole trip. Last, but not least, a big Thank you to Kumar our young porter. He did an amazing job carrying our heavy loads especially on the way to the Thorong La Pass and Gorepani. Very happy with my choice to book my trip with Nepal Eco Adventure team.  Suzi",10
26462,"The city tour and trekking guides were excellent. The reason we would not recommend Eco Tours is due to the lack of communication before and during the tour. I felt that the trek was not really tailored to my needs (being 16 weeks pregnant) and we did not know the exact length of the treks each day, even when we were shown them on the map. We also didn’t know what a ‘tea house’ was and what to expect for sleeping arrangements. The hotels were ok but not great and the one in our last stop off was particularly poor - View Point Hotel. During the trek, I had no idea how much longer I had to walk or how many more steps I needed to climb so I did not feel very well informed. We also did not know what to pack and that one porter would carry both of our bags so a kit list would have been really helpful.  We felt it was disorganised on the last day with our hotel being changed and the car not picking us up for the airport at the arranged time.  Although we were taken to ‘meet’ the coordinator, he did not share much information with us and we had to ask. Seeing as we didn’t really know what to ask, we missed key questions and didn’t really feel any wiser when we had left his office.  A great time in Nepal but not a great experience with Eco Tours. ",0
38498,It' a worthy tour and I had a wonderful time as a rum-lover!,10
355,"Good tasting, good guide, met friendly people! Would have liked to hear some more facts and figures about the production, but all in all very happy with it! Also the price seems very competitive. ",10
361,Loved seeing the brewery and hearing about the history.  Very entertaining and fun.  Also loved the beer and we will treasure the glasses.  Highly recommend.,10
38425,"Informative, well Run Tour.",10
317,Caleb was a great guide and your brews are fantastic!,10
327,"The tour and tasting was wonderful, though a bit expensive. Why is Anchor the only brewery around without a tap house? ",9
328,We had a difficult time hearing what was being said unless we were mid group to front of group.  With about 25 people we sometimes got caught in the back and missed out on that portion of the tour.  ,7
334,I would choose a 9 or a 10. I don't usually give 10s on anything because that would imply a head over heels love for something whereas a 9 means I really like it. ,9
38477,Great way to spend our son's 21st birthday. We all enjoyed learning the history and enjoying the tastings. The tour guide was entertaining and gave a great tour. ,10
42630,Lindsey answered all our questions clearly ... Of which there were many! ,10
762,"Very much love the hyper local vibe. Good beer, too",9
26376,"Tour guides and accommodations were great, and food was good, except at Chocolate on Santa Cruz. We sat for 30 minutes waiting for food while others around us were served, we didn’t even get bread our soup in that timeframe, so we walked out.  Also, we weren’t properly informed or prepared for the volcano hike on Isabella Island. If we had known about the expect d weather (very hot and dry) and the long distance (9 Miles) we would have brought more water in order to not run out half way through.  Lastly, my experience at the wetsuit place before snorkeling on Isabella Island was terrible. The man in charge was very rude and pushy, and made everyone (male and female) to change in the same room. I wasn’t able to put on my swimsuit before putting on the wet suit because there was no privacy, and I was very uncomfortable and embarrassed. When I asked him if he could stop watching me while I change he rudely said “sorry, it’s my job.” Worst part of the entire trip.  Overall, my experiences were mostly good, but those few standout negative experience would cause me to encourage friends to consider your trave company, but shop around first before booking with you.",6
12244,"You were very clear in the information on beforehand. The guide was exactly in time, despite the traffic jam. The guide was very experienced and shared this in a pleasant manner with us. He was very kind and we felt safe during the day. ",9
41503,Because it may or may not work.,5
41500,"Very informative, guide “D” was outstanding, facility and sercice was great, but felt somewhat generic. Didn’t feel like I was getting a product or access to something I couldn’t buy at home. I was looking for something a little less processed and more unique. ",8
40686,"It was very boring, I didn't learn much. The guide was taking facts and names for granted and we had no idea who those people were...",3
42069,Great experience for the entire family!! And everyone was so friendly.,10
38478,Bubba was a wonderful guide. We enjoyed the tour and the tasting very much.,10
38506,"Tour guide Bo was very knowledgeable and interesting. Everyone was very friendly. Our conversation with Jimmy Russell, Master Distiller, was very enjoyable and educational...made our day!",10
401,"Would love to see Anchor experiment w more IPA's. Also, additional info during tour of what differentiates various types of beer (I.e.lagers, ales, stouts,etc). Thank you! Was a fun afternoon!",8
394,"I brew a little, so it was great to learn how you do it. So much better than the Guinness tour in Dublin.",10
38610,Fantastic setup. The most organized brewery tour I’ve been on. Plenty of tastings. Enthusiastic and knowledgable staff. Loved the history. ,10
29879,"Jade Tours provided us with exceptional experiences with all 4 of the tours we did. Jason on the Manuel Park tour has an eagle eye for spotting and was so informative and very helpful getting great pictures with the scope. Jerimias plus the driver of the boat also spotted things that we would have never seen and really made the trip so much fun.  His lively personality and energy were great.  We especially loved having the white face monkeys join us on the boat for a photo shoot.  Juan took us on the Rainmaker Tour and again we were treated to someone so knowledgeable, patient and friendly.  The Catamaran tour was also a very nice way to spent the afternoon and do some ocean site seeing.  We can't say enough about all of the tours and the exceptional guides. We would recommend Jade Tours to anyone visiting the Manuel Antonio area.  ",10
32277,"We had a fabulous time. Our private transportation was always on time and dependable, and our driver, Minor, was very kind and helpful. Our guide, Tony, was fantastic. It was obvious he loves what he does and feels passionately about nature and the environment. He spotted all sorts of things as we walked along and took amazing pictures through his telescope, which we're so happy to have. He explained a lot about the flora and fauna, which we also appreciated. Both Tony and Minor went above and beyond when I realized I had left my bathing suit in our original private transportation van. I had only asked whether I'd be able to retrieve it at some other point after the tour, but Tony called Minor who happened to be in the area and he drove to meet us and drop it off. Thanks to them I was still able to swim near the waterfall and enjoy the hot springs, which meant everything to me. You have a wonderful group working with you and we loved being in a place that places so much value on its environment and protecting its ecosystems. We can't wait to visit again and we would certainly do more tours with you and recommend you to anyone else going. Thank you so much.",10
42276,Tina was an awesome hostess. Kept the tour lively. Product sampling was excellent. Buffet quality with unlimited rum punch was really good. ,10
779,"The guide was awesome, Delia. ",10
36510,"There were 3 vans travelling more or less together.  Maybe the other 2 vans were filled with only English speakers, but I think the vans should be organized according to languages spoken, when possible.  Our guide, Alex, didn't tell us much.  We had to always ask what time to meet back at a spot and not everyone asked so we wasted some time looking and waiting for people.  We didn't stop at the aqueduct.  I'm sure we could have if we had asked but I had already a picture so didn't need to ask.  He told us only 1 or 2 sentences per each place.  I don't think he's a very good guide.  All he told us about the Catedral was that it's closed because of carnival.  I have been on many tours and unfortunately this one was one of the worst.  Sorry.  ",5
40687,Our tour guide was very good. Our  cocktail guide was very good too! ,10
4511,"The atmosphere on the boat has been really nice. Great staff and participants. We had a lot of fun during the stops for the swim and the visit on the  Island. Our initial concern about the weather did not turn out and we were not hit by rain.  Thank you for the great day Elisabeth, Hugo, Johanna and Andreas",9
14567,"I approached it as a transportation service, in which your performance was less than ordinary . By changing the dates of the cruise, you also changed the weather. Despite sunny Saturday, Sunday was a cloudy day, making the cruise a freezing experience for anyone not wearing full Winter protection. We were soaked wet on the very first minutes, with waves crashing into the boat all the time. Poor management of toilets was another issue. The idea of stepping bare foot on anyone's urine should be resounding. Plus, there was the food, not a barbecue on board, but an improvised service, with poorly cooked sausages and reused disposable glasses. I was served a glass of water which, besides greased, had dirty on it. Unpleasant again. But the natural beauty made it for what the transportation service couldn't. Nature was impressive, the rest was not",0
475,"Too many people on the tour, thought there would be less and more intimate. Beer tasting was limited to four beers- should have been a few more (even if just shots- in order to get the full experience) x",5
489,Awesome!,10
38392,Very informative and the bus was great since it was a rainy day. We found a new favorite bourbon too:),10
38612,"I appreciated how personal the tour was, Edwinna was my tour guide and she did a great job explaining the process that Wild Turkey Bourbon is made. ",10
472,Great tour! And really enjoyed tasting the beers afterward and meeting the brewers and staff.,9
506,We love history and beer and this was the perfect combination of the two. Our tour guide was great and the tasting session at the end allowed us to try beers we hadn't had before.,10

28504,"Dear Sir/Madam,   We booked a day cruise with your Catamaran Cruise on the 16th of November. I understand the weather did not favour any of us and the whole day was practically unenjoyable. All 12 of us, were drenched in the rain whilst being in the catamaran throughout the whole day. Off course, you were not able to control the weather but you could've made our experience mildly enjoyable by clearly explaining the agenda for the day and who we were with. More about the route and the sites of interest.   Our experience with Catamaran Cruises has been a disappointing one, principally because of these few reasons: 1.  Very poor communication and engagement from crew members with passengers 2. Crews lack of knowledge about the route and area, upon enquiry 3. Lack of instruments or procedures to keep the passengers dry during the journey 4. Sub-standard selection of food.  We have already had a catamaran cruise ride to Gabriel island from Grand Baie with another company 2 days prior to your service. Least to say, we had a better time with that company than yours, despite them being more engaging with the passengers, wide selection of activities and food, informative crew members and finally half the price compared to your service.   All of the above considered, i won't be recommending your service to any of my friends or family members during their visit to Mauritius (or other destinations - should you operate elsewhere).  Thank you for reading.  Kind regards,  Alwin",1
32989,Good day  As already mentioned. we have paid Rs16 000 for transportation from our hotel to the catamaran and back for 34 people.  However we experienced many many problems with this:  1. The Bus sent could only hold 28 people 2. We had to take a taxi for the rest of the people 3. The bus that was sent was an employee bus and therefore the cops had stopped us for an hour and our cruise was therefore delayed 4. the bus door could not close for a while which is very dangerous for our passengers on board 5. The bus driver picked us up an hour late and we had another function to attend which delayed the whole party and he also hung up the phone when we tried contacting him 6. The bus driver demanded Rs8000 after he had dropped us back at the hotel 7. The seats were wet 8. there was no airconditioning  In all our travel we have never experienced such unprofessional and disappointing service. with all that said we expect a full refund of Rs16 000 as we did not receive the service that we had paid for. if you cannot refund us with that then we do want the Rs3000 and will take this to trip advisor for travels to take note of.  All that was done about this by catamaran cruises was an apology and a refund of Rs3000. Worst experience ever  Thanks Roopa on behalf of Nitin Soma,0

585,Great Tour by Caleb!,10
605,good tour,9
609,"The tour was great and Steven was an excellent guide. The beer was delicious, naturally, and we got to taste a nice variety!! I only didn't rate it as a ""10"" because the production line doesn't operate during the weekend, and we didn't get to see that part of production. ",9
623,Our guide was awesome - very informative and entertaining. Seeing the facility was great. And the beer was delish!,10
534,"Cool place, cool story, entertaining tour guide, and of course, great beer. ",10
526,"Caleb was amazing!! So knowledgeable, patient and entertaining. Would for sure recommend to a friend!",10
38613,Great tour guide. Wonderful history. Fun tap room. ,9
5892,"The advanced tour preparations by Celia's colleague were great.  Celia was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about Borough Market and the many delicious items that we tasted. Her contacts with many stall holders meant we tried interesting, tasty and varied food and drink items.  It was a great morning and we would not have made the most of the market if we had been on our own.  I would certainly recommend Celia's tour.",10
9400,Good mixture of history and food tastings in manageable group size,10
706,"the tour was a bit underwhelming. because there was no brewing in progress, the whole process was kind of opaque; we had the big equipment and the guide's description. maybe some kind of graphics or photos would help. was great to see the facility and kettles, but it was hard to really understand the. teeing process.",5
770,Tour was absolutely Fantastic! Mike went above and beyond he devoted his entire time to giving us so much information. We walked away from the brewery feeling like this was the best part of San Francisco itself. ,10
26250,"8 day budget tour, party of 2. It was a wonderful experience, everyone we met has been lovely and attentive. We have found, however, that the tours became somewhat reiterative; not so much the activities but the information provided by the guides (which is understandable, they have no way of knowing what we've been told already).  Towards the end the activities seemed less stimulating. Some of this is the loss of the shock factor, granted, but some activities proved rather anticlimactic, like Concha Perla and Flamingo Lagoon: maybe those can be paired up in one afternoon and you can have an extra day for a different activity? Or offer an option where that extra day can be created and left for the guests to have a beach day.  The hotel in Isabela was great in terms of comfort, esthetics, service, food, etc. The only thing is that it seems to be surrounded by roosters that kept waking everybody up as from 4am and never seemed to quiet down throughout the day, even in the late afternoon (this not only happened to us, we checked with the rest of the guests). It is an observation in general in both Isabela and Santa Cruz hotels that the walls are paper thin. This perhaps is a structural thing in general in the archipelago but it happened on occasion to be woken up by the neighbouring rooms' televisions or conversations (no raised tones, just regular conversations) or the animals in neighbouring buildings.  It is also a shame that in such a long stay a third island cannot be included! I haven't checked your other packages, perhaps in non-budget options this exists, but perhaps a third island would be a nice addition to the experience.   Regardless, the experience overall was wonderful. Snorkeling in Santa Cruz was amazing, probably the best snorkeling of the trip in terms of water clarity and observable biodiveristy. The excursions are also lovely! The fact that the tours are usually private or in reduced groups is excellent. The food is also great, the more fish served the better. In Isabela there were no menu options like there were in Santa Cruz, but it was alright. The guides were all pleasant, polite and eager to answer questions. One big plus is haveng everything taken care of and not having to worry over things like transportation, lodging, meals, etc. It all seemed to be very well coordinated. Theo and Joseph were on top of everything and had a very approachable demeanor.  ",8
42070,"The tour was the perfect length of time, with a great mix of history, technical production steps and humor. Bubba was an amazing guide. In fact, my husband was quoting him all weekend, even on other tours. The tasting room was beautiful and allowed a great photo opportunity. I might suggest coming up with a wild turkey hashtag to allow visitors to share thier photos with your social media accounts. This may help advertise your great amenities. Thank you. ",10
41706,I’ve done several rum distillery tours & this was the best ever.  There was plenty of rum samples!  The tour guide was awesome! The food was superb! I will definitely book this tour again when I return to Barbados.,10

39987,My husband and I really enjoyed this tour. Heather the tour guide... I think that’s her name was great and funny. The bus driver was just as knowledgeable. We had a great time. This was our 7th tour that weekend and it stood out. And my husband who isn’t a bourbon fan like me finally found one he can sip. Thanks wild turkey! ,10

42931,Helio was great - he kept us engaged and entertained while teaching us the basics of Samba and Forro. We also appreciated getting o see a variety of dance venues and watch the locals samba!,10
42574,Our tour guide didn't smile once.,8
42610,We took the cocktail workshop tour and had a blast (I would have said that even if we hadn't won the competition).  Everyone at the visitor's center was very nice.  The tour guide was very informative and personable.  Our workshop guru made the competition educational as well as fun.,10
38484,"We came to the meeting point and the tour was cancelled, because other tourists didn't come due to frosty weather.  It was quite disappointing ",0
41638,I have visited 4 times. Love it! In the past the tour guide was more informative and shared more history about Wild Turkey and the surrounding area. I really pumped it up to my travel companions and our tour didn't lice up to their expectations. It was shorter and less informative than years past. ,7
12278,"Knowledgeable tour guides and a great inside look at many historic buildings. The samples were also great, and nice that is wasn't just Bud and Bud Light :)",10

814,"I've always loved your beer. The tour itself was a bit short but still interesting to see, and even more interesting to hear the history. If the tour had been a bit longer I'd definitely rate a 10!",8
815,"Quality of brews, easygoing atmosphere & service.",10
822,The tour was very informative. Our guide gave us cool background information about the company that we never knew. The beer tasting was just the icing on the cake!,10
797,"Loved the experience - and would have enjoyed it more seeing the brewery actually functioning. While it makes sense that folks might want weekends off, mentioning upfront that the action was shut down for the day would have been good. The tastings were plentiful and our guide did a great job considering it was his first week!  We'd actually like to come back for the distillery tour -- guess we'll plan for a weekday! ;-)",9
799,"Mike (I believe his name was) was a very good story teller! He answered all questions well. It was a great tour, very clean premises. It was great to feel the history around you while you are tasting! Thank you!",10
43389,All of the tour staff were very friendly and were very knowledgeable about the Anchor Brewery history.  I enjoyed all of the different tasting beers.  Thank you for a great tour.  ,8
42575,"We visited Wednesday, March 28, 2017, and had an excellent, behind the scenes experience. Our guide and your staff were more than kind and open with their explanations.

859,"a tour through anchor brewing brings history to life, to see firsthand the beauty in the brewery that fritz maytag built and to taste the beers that he crafted is something special. ",10
843,"My boyfriend and I have done the tour several times when we have friends visiting and each time we have gone our tour guides have been friendly and informative, you get a generous amount of beer tastings, and of course the beer is delicious!  ",10

43770,Great I fo.,9
42279,I would have liked to spend a little more time in the museum part of the tour. There were a lot of cool things that I didn’t get to see because we ran out of time! About 10 more minutes would have been great.,9
43675,"The whole experience was great. The welcome we received from the woman at check in was warm and friendly.  She made us feel more than comfortable as we had two small children.  The tour guide was very knowledgeable.  We were interested to find out the whole back story of the brewery.  He was very passionate about his job.  Most importantly the beers are incredible.  We had two beers we never had before, one was the double Bock by one of your brewers and the other was a beer from your sister brewery in Hong Kong.  I am a long time drinker of your beers this was my first time visiting and I hope to return.  ",10

875,BEER!! Great tour/history. Not boring at all.,10
900,"It was informative, entertaining, and very tasty.  Friendly and a great conversation.  I'd recommend coming for early tours where there are fewer people; it sounds like the later times get very crowded.   Compared to other tours, though, there was a tad less ""seeing"" stuff.  It was about 90% in the tasting room and 10% in the brewery.  I know it would probably be intrusive to all the workers, though.  Perhaps when your larger brewery is finally finished near ATT Park, there will be more to see, and without intrusion.   Thanks .. I have already recommended to several friends and will review positively.",9

It was a little difficult to find at first, but I don't think I would have trouble finding it again. The gift shop has great items. I thought the t-shirts were a little high at $22, though.

We were hoping to get a solid overview of the history of Budapest, but felt we had to ask all the questions in order to get any answers. We also asked a few questions our guide did not know the answers to. With hindsight it would have been cheaper to hire our own bikes - we didn't think there was much of a tour at all, more just a stop off at each monument. Expensive for what it was and disappointing unfortunately.",3

They explained each and every step in very detailed manner, eliminating any sort of fear that I had. All and all it was perfect, and highly recommend this to everyone. There was one issue though, i had chosen for an outside video package and the pictures and videos did not come out to be the quality that i wanted. Like I really wanted a picture or a shot of me jumping out of the plane and with plane in the background and blue sky around it. This, i think is something that the camera man should have taken into account. Because of most of the pictures that i received were either over exposed or were not of me, it was of the skydiver who i was attached to. I would like skydive-athens to please train there cameraman for better quality and better angle shot of videos and photos. Awesome experience",8

9904,"It was a Little crowded, From tickets to tour needed to ask where to wait? how long is tour? and how to differentiate those going on tour from those having drinks. Then they said they would make a call when tour was to begin. It was really just a call from center of room. It is something you had to pay attention to. Or you could miss the call. Its a nice place.

Catering a tour to the group can be good (for example, one of the members wanted to try falafel, so we waiting for a while at a falafel place), but when the group is mixed with different parties and interests, that is not always great. Also, there was a member in the group that was over 70 and walked very slowly with a cane. I felt we missed more that we could have seen had the group all been able-bodied.  Our guide was very nice and very knowledgeable, but it seemed she was making it up as she went. She even had to use the Google Maps on her phone to determine how to get to the next market.",5

1497,No food offered.,8
1501,It would have been cool to actually see them processing beer or the bottling line going. I feel like since I paid extra for the weekend happy hour tour this would have added to the experience. Instead I feel like I paid extra to actually see less since the tour guide kept saying if you come during the week (when it is cheaper) you get to see more. This would have influenced by decision to tour in it had been disclosed in the website while buying the tickets. I much rather would have liked to see things working. I enjoyed the new Los gigantes beer!,7

9187,"Did not get our money's worth.   The Sierra Negra volcano hike had to be cancelled because of our flight delay - this I can understand. But the other activities weren't that great either. We paid money because you are supposed to be the expert. When we informed about our flight delay, you could have arranged a Los Tuneles/Los Tintoreras snorkeling trip (which we offered to pay extra for) instead of Concha Perla, which was literally a walking distance from the hotel.  If the boats from Santa Cruz to Isabela are so limited, WHY would you schedule the trip for the very same day the flight arrives that too just 2 hours after the flight's arrival time? Aren't you guys supposed to be the experts?  I was terribly disappointed with my experience. I would really like to know what justifies the heavy $2500 fee after this.",1

However I appreciate that you sample both the original and Diamond Peak plus making the sample glass a part of the tour. While I almost did not due the tour because of the cost I think that it was well worth it.

Daniel had answers to our every question about past and current spanish history. Daniel Knew all the stops including ""the cherrie window"" a stop to buy delicious fresh picked cherries in the home of a farmer. We were invited in to sample the cherries, they were delicious, fresh and chemical free! I bought a large box for 6 euro. Next the mineral pool to swim, snorkel, and a rope climb into a cave. A delicious lunch in a local village followed, amazing fresh vegetables and fish was served. Lunch was followed by some more sites to see! Touring with Valtournative was the highlight of our 3 week trip through Spain, France and Italy. We highly recommend this company. Many thanks for the outstanding day! ",10

28357,"We were not provided with complete information on aspects of the tour, particularly that the meals we would be getting would be the same as the budget tour.  Also, the guides on each island and the tour itself was disorganized and did not seem to communicate with each other or know anything about us (e.g. that one of us couldn't swim). They didn't give us set timelines until the day before, and then they told us one time that they would pick us up but ended up picking us up different times.  Once, they told us a few times that they would pick us up at 2 pm; however, we got a call at 1:30 pm and we weren't ready since we were told 2 pm.  Another time, we were told we would be picked up at 8:40 am but they didn't show up until 9 am.  The tours on Isabela were very rushed and the guide walked so fast that we struggled to keep up with him, and we didn't have time to stop to take pictures or enjoy ourselves, and we ended up with lots of blisters on our feet.  He was just focused on beating another tour group and getting ahead of that group so we could finish our hikes first, which should not be the case.  It was also disorganized because the guides didn't seem to know we were staying at a different hotel from everyone else, and the guides on Santa Cruz didn't know that we opted out of dinners, even though we were told that that information would be communicated with them.  The itinerary wasn't clear on timelines so we didn't know what time of day activities would start or end. Also, the driver on the last day didn't know that we were supposed to go to see the Twin craters before going to the port to get to the airport, and it was only after he took us straight to the port and we asked about the craters that he turned back to take us there.  Overall, there was a lot of miscommunication and it didn't seem like the guides talked to each other or to Rebecca Adventure Travel as they didn't seem to know what was going on most of the time.",2
5629,"smart, knowledgeable, and engaging driver gave us a fantastic history lesson about London. great way to see all the major sights",10

Our party of 7 asked the guide and he said he didn't know and asked us to check with the bartender. Waited 10 mins for bartender to finally approach us. Then told us to just give him a first name and that's it. Seems pointless, confusing, and waste of time. We could literally of not paid for a tasting, told the guide we checked in, and received it for free.  Besides that the liquor was nice and one person bought a bottle.",5

1882,"I've already mentioned it to a couple of people I met in the hotel. Also, I took a tour of Hatikvah Market with a different company and it was similar but not nearly as good. The tour was too big for the setting (meaning we could hardly fit in the small places and were in the way of shoppers), the guide didn't ""control"" the group they stopped to shop (which held up the entire group repeatedly) and she lost her way in the market. I would definitely recommend Delicious again!",10

Accidently , we find a couple which booked through him. their taxi driver let us speak to abed, and we finally got into the jungles. there we met another guy namedJohnny , who told us that we are transfered into another lodge instead of the original lodge we booked (which we knew its a common thing they do ). that guy was completly telling us lies and was impatiance about our complains. when we got to the new lodge we found out  that there was not water in the bathroom at all , and the meals that were served werent satisfied at all. we got a tour guide named silma who didnt even speak english and has  no idea about the schedule. the other couple we met at the airport was with us along the way and was disappointed too. to sum up , we dont recomend booking through your agency.",0

16217,"Ein Trip der sich lohnt! Perfekt! Great! Thank you! Nikos vielen Dank an dich und dein Team für ein tolles Abenteuer. Auch als ungeübte Paddler konnten wir den Full-Day-Trip bewältigen, da du uns in den wunderschönsten Buchten mit leckeren griechischen Köstlichkeiten verwöhnt hast. Wir konnten in den Pausen im Wasser oder am Strand entspannen, schnorcheln und hatten Spass daran, das Kajak als Sprungbrett zu benutzen. Du hast uns unterwegs einiges über die Gegend erklärt und viele Fotos gemacht, damit dieser Tag für uns unvergesslich bleibt. Falls wir nochmal nach Chalkidiki kommen, machen wir die Sunset-Tour!  Gruss aus Germany von Torsten, Heidi, Jana und Lukas ",10
675,"I am a Colorado nativ and I'm always looking for ways to promote our local businesses. I had never experienced Stranahan's so when my son ( an avid whiskey fan) came into town, we thought this would be fun. Our tour guide, Katie, was awesome! She had a great knowledge of the operations and a welcome sense of humor. I will suggest this as the ""go to"" tour for all of my friends! ",10

43017,The superb product...and the presentation!!!  Bubba was the best!,10
58792,"We didn't make it in time for the tour, just the tasting portion. It was almost impossible to hear Bubba and understand what he was saying. He needs to use a microphone for the tasting portion of the tour.",6
671,"It has been a few years since I did the tour, maybe 5 years or so? This was my 3rd tour and it was great. Preserved the handcrafted character of Stranahan's but added more structure. So a little more ""organized"" or ""corporate"" but still intimate. (The first two times I did the tour though, I really enjoyed both.) I really like the tasting in the barrel room. That was a nice area to do it in. I really like the last tasting room too and the new bar area. It feels a lot warmer than the old place. The fact that we got to keep our little cups was a major bonus! Our tour guide, whose name I forget but who had streaks of purple hair, was excellent. Knowledgeable, fun, clearly enjoys her job and clearly believes in Stranahan's. Good job. I love Stranahan's and I love the Stranahan's tour!!! (I still covet a bottle of Snowflake.)",10

1902,"Everything was excellent, the beers, the guys that received us, the explanations and the production line visit. Except by the lady at the shop, who was very impolite and made me and my friends uncomfortably in front of other customers, being very rude during our shopping time.",10
38826,We had a awesome tour and our tour guide was very funny. ,10
1890,From reading the reviews online,10
1891,"I thought the guide was great, really knowledgeable and interesting and I can tell he has a great interest in the environment and preservation.  I though there was a little too much wasted time, stopping for gas, waiting for the boat, waiting for a whale to show up.  I actually got sick that day but if I hadn't I would've liked more time snorkeling and maybe exploring the island. ",7

He answered questions and covered key sites but was flexible with time spent in areas and personalized the tour for us. We would highly recommend this tour and guide to others.",10
133588,I took the tour in 2010 and I must say it has improved a lot since then. We enjoyed the tour very much. I only wish the food in the garden after had not been so expensive. It was good and our waitress was so sweet. She gave us suggestions for other things to do while in the area. Very friendly staff all around from the minute we got there till we left. Very impressive ,10
19298,"Waaay understaffed. Our two appetizers took forever to make it out to us, I actually had to remind the overwhelmed bartender that we ordered. We went there for a tour, what a joke. I loved Red Hook beer before, my favorite, now...not so much. To top it off was a discusting coffee beer as the final taster. What the hell? Totally disappointed, unfortunately a Red Hook customer no more.",0

13345,"We all really enjoyed our tour, our guide was helpful and knowledgeable. We were lucky to be in a small group (10 people only); I think more than 12-14 people would have been less enjoyable. We also had good weather most of the way, which allowed beautiful views on Mt Stapafell. Tak!",9

5705,Christine was great,10
16992,Whiskey is sub-par,9
17000,Collected promptly at designated pick up time (and dropped off) by mini bus and delivered to meet coach in Chania. English speaking informative guide. Air con and comfortable coach apart from not much leg room. Ok just for my daughter and I but a lot of men around us struggled with this so kept complaining around us. ,9
15258,"Although the jump was rescheduled 3 times, on the last occasion with less than one hours notice,  we found the staff who were actually here in Crete (especially Raph), and who looked after Alfred on the day,  to be very professional and friendly. ",10

8136,We had a thoroughly enjoyable 3 hours with a very pleasant knowledgeable lady.,10
716,We definitely enjoyed our tour and our guide was great. But as scotch drinkers we found the wiskey a little middle of the road for our taste. We'd recommend the tour to any of our friends but probably wouldn't by a bottle of Stranahan's whiskey ourselves. ,7
720,"Great tour guide! Also, felt like I really got my money's worth with two tastings and a glass",10
7985,"This was a really bad trip! Comfortable rooms? That's a big joke! Nothing was comfortable in this room! It was dirty, the ""bath"" is a joke, the mattress is so thin that you feel the bead... Our Guide Juan doesn't care about all members of the group! On Lake Sandoval he run with the 4 of 6 people in front. We where not so fast,but he doesn't care. We don't see him and the rest of the group for a long time. On the way back he says,we can take so much time as we need,he will waiting at the boat. What the fuck?! I told him that he is the guide and have to take care about all group members,not only of 4! He just laugh. I'm gonna get my money back and give pictures of the ""Lodge"" to a lawyer! This trip was shit!!!",0

10489,Learned a lot.,8
25648,"Food and drinks were great, the tour was informative and fun. The only thing we got annoyed at is that when I ordered the waiter told me my meal came with fries or I could get sweet potato tots. He never mentioned it was 2 dollars extra. We were surprised when we got our bill. It wasn't enough to cause a fuss over, it just would have been nice if he was upfront, instead it came off sneaky.",9

44109,"Loved our tour guide, Thomas!  He was funny and very informative.  I would definitely recommend. ",10

The gentleman leading our group was very nice and super interactive with the group and of course we enjoyed the beer and enjoyed learning about how it’s made. My only feedback was at times it was hard to hear the group leader. Thank you for the wonderful experience I hope to bring more friends another time ,10
10530,"Marios is knowledgeable, personable, professional. All three tours were well planned and enjoyable. Feel like we got a good feel for both historical and present day Cyprus and its people. Looking forward to visiting again!",10
10515,"Overall a great experience. Friendly staff w good service, they deserve a 10! The tour itself a 7 because it felt like the three stops were rushed, you didn't have time to fully enjoy them. I also think that if the catamaran har been fully booked (with what, 30 people?) we wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. Now we had the chance to move around freely with lots of space. So we end up with an 8+. :) ",8
8178,"Very good tour by a knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide, passionately interested in her subject.",9
730,I liked the added 2 tasting experience as well as the taster glasses included now. In the past I would often go when it was free because every tour you get a little tid bit of information that maybe you didn't on the last one however this tour was very comprehensive and like taking 4 of the old tour. Worth the $10. ,10

1951,Everyone with the company was extremely friendly and helpful,10
8205,"We have attended many free tours in various European cities and what we experienced was not consistent with prior tours. Tour participants were interrupting the guide and asking questions that they should have obtained from a Tourist Information center, causing the guide to get off track with his talk. Also who needs a 20 minute break in the middle of a 2.5 hour tour?",0

4699,"I loved my guide, Chatra was incredibly helpful during my decision making process, and the overall experience exceeded my expectations. The only reason I chose not to give a 10 is because I saw on a few occasions the porters and guide leave garbage along the trail. Since the company name is Nepal Eco Adventure I expected the staff to pay extra care in minimizing their impact on the environment. ",8
10433,Fantastic experience learning about the food. The food samples were delicious. ,10

1972,Dana was a fantastic tour guide!,10
8283,"Garvan was great on the pub crawl.  The only issue was that it wasn't clear in advance what was/wasn't included in the cost.  First round of beers included, not after that, and I paid for at least one of his beers.  My fault for not clarifying in advance how that worked.  Other than that, Garvan was a lot of fun and great to be with for the evening.  Thanks!",10

1976,"I filled out a feedback card in person, too. The waitstaff was kind and knowledgeable. The facilities were clean and well kept.

10510,Really enjoyed the bike ride in the morning... we had Ronny and he was really caring and made sure we were all safe on the bike tour and gave us good tips and suggestions on how to ride safely. It was so much fun trying to ride up to the top of El Morro.  I also had a go pro and got to take some fun footage of my ride thru the city...  There were spots where it was a bit hard to take the bikes up and down the steps but it just added to the experience... it was nice to have a guide if biking for the first time in the streets of Lima... as you could spend the day trying to weave your way thru Barranco and El Morro on your own... definitely a great way to start my trip in Peru...,10

There was a nice, fresh breeze once we cleared Grand Baie and I fully expected the crew to raise sails, but no such luck. We motored the whole trip, back and forth.

It would have been a 10 with a slightly more detailed map.  When we got to the end of the solid red lines, we had to resort to Google maps on how to get to the Planetarium.  And it was on our way back that we found a better path along the ocean.  But it was a nice day for a ride and it all worked out great in the end.",9

4984,"Tour guide on Monday 10 April was kind of a dick.  Talking about how he would ""accomodate"" a special request for Porter at the tasting room.  talking about how flash pasteurizing was ""not my decision"" as opposed to explaining why Anchor does it.  Didn't know if they weight down the dry-hopping sacks in the tank or just let them float.  All in all kind of an unpleasant personality that didn't do much to personalize the story. ",10

40720,"The entire tour experience was wonderful. We were on the 2:10 Bud Light tour. The tour guide was awesome and the tour itself is great! I’ve done the free tour before, but this one was so worth the money! There was only one part of the day  that I was disappointed in, the 2 girls handling the Clydesdale that was in front of the Biergarten for pictures. They were unfriendly at best, rude is probably a better word. They stand there with scowls on their faces and everyone who approaches seems to irritate them. They answer people’s questions as quickly and curtly as possible. Huge disappointment! People are excited about the horses and the handlers should be as warm and friendly as everyone else.   The experience is still a 10/10 because the tours are so well-organized and just being there is so cool! Hire handlers who enjoy interacting with the public (your customers).  ",10

13625,"The day my tour was scheduled the weather was terrible. There was a high wind advisory, rain, and terrible fog. While I understand that the weather on a glacier is never going to be ideal, the staff had to have known that we would not be able to see anything on the glacier due to the fog and that the ride would be extremely uncomfortable due to the high winds. Despite this, the staff did not offer any warning about the weather when we arrived or offer to reschedule the trip or refund our money. When we returned from the trip, the staff inside the building asked how the trip went. Several of us said how awful it was, and all the woman working the desk did was smile and nod. No one apologized for taking us up in the terrible weather or offered to do anything to make up for how bad it was. This gave me the impression that this is very typical for this company, and that all they care about is making money. This was absolutely the worst experience of my entire trip to Iceland, and I will not recommend Snaefellsjokull Glacier Tours to anyone.",0

She went above and beyond by looking up images of local artisans' products to see if I'd like to go to those stores as well. She was polite and easy to talk to and always looked out for me best interests. The glass of wine in a small garden behind a wine bar was the perfect end to the perfect shopping tour.

2369,"Dives were great and the crew was very accommodating. Adriel, our dive master had a great sense of humour and was very helpful, energetic, and supportive. I would recommend bringing your own gear if you have it. The one complaint was the quality of the rental equipment. Hoses for the regulator were frayed; bite-wings on the mouthpieces were in some cases worn off. Turning my head sideways during one dive caused air to escape from the joint between the hose and the mouthpiece. The pressure gauge on another octopus had lost its retaining clip and was loosely seated in the housing. A third octopus had no depth gauge at all; fortunately I had a dive computer with me. In three days of diving, I had gone through 4 octopi with Agua Clara--not the most comforting experience when diving in cenotes where you don't always have an option to just surface if anything goes seriously wrong. I also had a failed light during a cenote dive and my backup light/torch didn't work either. Fortunately, Adriel had a spare that he loaned me for the rest of the dive.",9

His knowledge and love for the environment is impressive and admirable. The tour itself was a good mix is exercise and relaxing, without a long drive to and from the starting point. In fact, the drive was pleaseant and exactly as advertised; nothing about this trip was misleading or embellished. My wife and I are very skeptical of yours, and usually avoid them. This was a pleasant surprise. I wouldn't hesitate to book with MexiTreks again, and I would request Arturo!",10

Since there are no maps of the trails I would have been very uncomfortable hiking that without a guide. Also, the fact that you walk on private land and have to go through their gates would have made me nervous. My Spanish is not the best and it made me feel so much better going with someone who not only spoke Spanish well, but also knew the farmers whose land we were walking on. ",10

13681,"Very professional service, easy communication, comfortable cars and really friendly drivers who tried their best to drive as gently as possible through the rough hairpin turns through the mountains. Only little point that results in a 9 instead of 10 is that it would be nice to have a confirmation email for our second tour (in addition to the first) one or two days in advance just to be sure. However, when asking for this ourselves, we immediately got a positive reply.",9

And the whole thing about leaving the Chipotle vodka off the tasting and not saying anything about it until the very end was very shady.

Our guide was fairly knowledgeable on the ins and outs of the distillery, however there were quite a few things that were glossed over more than our group would have liked. The tour overall was informative and it was great to get to try 2 whiskeys! I gave the tour itself a 9 because of these reasons.

The gear shift on my bike barely worked. We biked at night without a bell on my bike and no lights or reflectors for the group. This is very unsafe and illegal in my country. We litterally had police chasing us and blowing whistles that we were on a path that could not be biked in the park. We have been on at least 20 bike tours around the world and this was the worst one!,0

15990,"Our tour guide was fine, so the rating isn't a rating on her. The upstairs area where the tour started was just too noisy to hear much. Not sure why we just sat in such a noisy area for the first 45 minutes or so of the tour. Sure, we could see some of the tanks and equipment, but the upstairs  location really didn't help to better acquaint us with the specifics of the brewing process--it sort of ended up being a general overview from up above. Also, not sure I'd really call this a tour since most of the time was spent sitting in one place rather than walking around the facility, seeing and smelling things while discussing the brewing process and how Avery makes its beers so special. Even by the time we got downstairs at the end of the tour the tour guide had to compete with the background music making it hard to hear what was being said. I did appreciate the tour guide's mentioning your Islay stout. It is an absolutely outstanding beer and I may have not tried it except for her recommendation and description of the beer. Please rethink the format of your tours to make them more of an actual tour and less of a lecture in very difficult and not particularly informative location at the brewery.",2

By the by, the tour was fine, but being so high up on the walkway within the building seemed to amplify heat and noise to distracting levels. It'd be nice if tour guides didn't have to shout to be heard. I toured a loud factory (Kohler) that had headsets for guests that connected to a audio system (bluetooth hotspots of some sort?) that tour guides used to speak to guests, using their own headset and mic combo; it worked great. That might be overkill for Avery tours, but even a portable little amp perhaps could have helped. But still, it wasn't so bad that at the end of the day we couldn't say it prevented up from enjoying our visit to the new digs.",10
6559,Stavros and Maria were great!  So enthusiastic and worked so hard to show us the sights and make sure we had a good time.  They even picked us up from the ferry at the end of our trip and brought us on a mini tour of Lavrio and Temple of Poseidon before dropping us off at the airport.  ,10
58904,"The tour was informative and the brewery is interesting to look at - seeing the copper kettles was a real highlight. Also, the tasting was very generous!",10
5368,"Fergal was fabulous! My husband, son and I hired him for a private tour upon our arrival from the states. He was charming and personable and kept us walking and engaged with the sites of Dublin; the 3+ hours flew by. Our teenage son couldn't believe it was over nor could we! His tour covered from the Viking period all the way to modern times. At the end he even sat with us in a coffee shop and helped us plan the rest of our stay in other parts of Ireland. He deserves a ""First class Honors""!",10

135435,Price is fair  The person giving the tour is very knowledgeable and professional. Good facts and history telling. It put anchor in the map for me which I didnt know anything about this brand. A must if in vacation in SFO. Tour takes you back in time and bar next door is really cool. ,10
1940,"We were fortunate enough to be in a small group for the tour, which I think only enhanced the experience. Chelsea was very informative and fun! The tour is a must if you are visiting Stranahan's. I would recommend it every time!",10

58897,"First, nobody ever asks my recommendation for anything to drink and second, I'm reluctant to offer any such without having been asked.  I don't know if your survey goes on so I thought I'd stick a few comments here.  The tour was quite interesting and informative and the 3:00 guide was excellent (knowledgeable, great presentation skills, funny).  The samples were reasonably sized and the products we tried were quite good.  We're still partial to Scotch whiskys such as Glenlivet, Laphroaig, Talisker....",0

6640,"Louis, the tour was great.  The people that showed up for the tour was large, about 30, but he was able to handle us without any problem although the crowd around us was huge.  He taught us about the history and culture of Brugge in a humorous and entertaining manner.  We were able to enjoy the scenery of these beautiful city and could not wait to stop at a historical site to listen to another story from  Louis.  Best walking tour I've had at any price ",10

6701,It was such a fun experience and the man that I went jumping with was very knowledgeable!,10
42793,Party was far too big. Most walk tours we have done have 20 people Max which makes it more personal and interesting. Difficult to listen and concentrate to the guide with so many people there and there were a lot of people allowed on the tour who hadn’t pre-booked,3
2019,"I always love taking the Stranahan's tour. Our guide was a little overly focused on ""getting us to the whiskey,"" which I found odd--it was an 11a.m. tour--but otherwise he was good.  I'm not in love with the fact that it costs money (I've been recommending it for months to customers at my shop and saying it was free), but the free glass at the end softens that blow.  I'll still keep coming--I've loved Stranahan's for awhile and don't see that love affair ending anytime soon.",10

Hope to get back before too long.",10
6826,"My husband and I signed up for the kayaking trip from Richmond, I was very nervous and certain I would end up in the water!  Piers was lovely and very encouraging, showing us all the moves needed and gave us snippets of interesting history as we went along.  I really enjoyed it and my initial nerves left me as we travelled up the Thames, around Eel Pie Island and beyond.  Fabulous experience and I would recommend it to anyone.  We are not youngsters (mid 50s) and managed, so I would encourage anyone to have a go!",10
6920,,10

115671,Toured both the main distillery and the bottling plant. My friend and I were the only two on the Sunday morning tour of the bottling plant and the guide treated us very well. He didn't phone it in because there were just two of us. It was interesting to see the mechanized process for the standard and Small batch verse the manual process for the Single Barrels.

6542,"Great organisation, quick email replies from Chattra, best route for EBC in terms of acclimatization, 4 guides for the big group were a big help, I personally loved Dhanna's pace and style. On the downside, I think Goma Air is a bad choice, seeing all flights leaving to Lukla except the ones for Goma was disheartening and put serious doubts on whether we will be able to reach Lukla. ",10
6925,"I felt that there were too many people on the boat , in Grand Baie we did a cruise with 21 people on and was much more personal. Very disappointed in not going up to the Water Fall . last time I did that , the catamaran was anchored and tender boats took us straight up to the water fall , that gave some people the chance to snorkel while they waited their turn. Would have preferred the catamaran to take us to Tour Roche where taxi would have picked us up , rather than sail back to where we started , this would have given an extra hour at Il Aux Cerf",6

Most of the stallions had been turned out when we got there but she saved them for last and we got to see them brought in from their paddocks, they posed for our cameras and we got to see them get their baths before their next breeding sessions. It is such a wonderful opportunity just to get to see these world famous stallions and I appreciated the kindness of all we met who worked on the farm.",10

The tastings (especially 2 tastings during the tour) were great and we liked being able to select the final 2 tastings.  The little gift was a nice surprise.  Overall, it was definitely worth $20+ and the time.  The one downside was the processing fees charged in the reservation.",9

We felt rush and unwelcome from the moment we walked in.  My husband ordered a Cusquena Red and the waiter brought a Dark Lager and told us we would have to pay for the beer, because she returned back to the barrel.  The food was fair and cold.  A very disappointed experience for an upscale organic establishment.",4
42676,Very cool tour wish we could get closer to horse though,10
3049,John was great at explaining the process and very knowledgeable. You can really tell he is passionate about what he does and is like a kid in a candy shop. We also enjoyed all the samples you guys generously offered to. We were so impressed by the ethereal gins particular the G batch which my wife and I purchased along with the smoke and peat burbon. You guys have a good thing going. Keep up the good work.  P.S. we also enjoyed the 100 year rye which we had to puchase to.,10
7011,It was a personal and individual trip where you have the  opportunity to create a special athmosphere on the boat and the crew was well trained to attend to you,9
3226,"My only ""frustration"" was that I had 3 people cancel while we (11 of us) were on our way to the tour, and when I let the tour guide know this--he wasn't sympathetic regarding the fact that I'd paid for everyone already online (because there was no other way to pay or make reservation). There were well over 30 total in our tour group. I know that you have a cancellation policy, but, obviously I had no control over the people canceling and you didn't lose anything in their absence. I would have appreciated either credit toward purchase or I would have been impressed had you offer a ""pay it forward"" option--like, allow me to apply credit toward either your favored charity/cause, or even someone else's tour...",8
7035,James was spectacular. ,9
7051,"The staff at Rich Coast is incredible. This was our first diving experience and they were so patient with us. After diving the first time and seeing eels and beautiful fish and amazing marine life, we wanted to go again!

8955,Because we reserved and paid a  3/4 hour  steam whistle tour with porter escape maybe 2 months ago. This weed end we tried to schedule our tour and it wasn't possible because it was the open  doors and free for a 15 minutes tour. Porter escape don't want to reemboursement us.,0
3245,"The tour was really cool. I loved seeing the actual places while learning about the process of whiskey production. Our tour guide seemed a little rehearsed and bored with saying the same old thing every time. However, she was very knowledgeable in the content. Tasting was one of my favorite parts. Both learning how to taste correctly and experiencing the different flavors that come about with different ways of drinking it. It was so cool that we got to keep our own etched shot glass as a keepsake from our visit to Stranahan's. Overall, would recommend to a friend and would even go back myself. Another great part was the room with games! Our group arrived a little while early for the tour so it was perfect to have a  room to relax in and even games to entertain us until the tour commenced!

He not only answered every question, he seemed incredibly into beer and I really felt like I learned something.  Nice work.  This will now be my go-to spot to take out of town people for a beer tour and SD beer.",10
7300,"Too many different guides, excessive time wasted at airport, a little miscommunication ... too much communication on email, but then once you get there things are not clear.  Once in tour, too much time wasted, there is no need to snorkel twice, or spend 1 h in a beach under the sun. There could be more items fit in the schedule ",5

She taught new techniques, sparked creativity, all while making it fun with games embedded into the class. I look forward to attending more of her classes. ",10
14122,We were disappointed that we were taken up the mountain even though the clouds had descended and there was obviously zero visibility. Sitting in the back of a snowcat in fog that meant you couldn't even see the ground felt very very unsafe. I know your guides know the mountain and you are experienced but to be honest I would have preferred a refund than that. I got the impression we were taken up so we didn't need a refund even though the conditions were so obviously terrible. £387 wasted....,3

8995,My comment is for your doors open experience. The event at Toronto.ca said your tours were unscheduled which they weren't and then it wasn't clear on your website if doors open tours got a sample or not. Your staff were nice but not all of them had equal knowledge about what happens that weekend and there was no signage on the outdoor patio saying how much beers were. ,5

When we went into the beer hall the wait was 2 hours. We could have used the hour on tour and would have been comfortable waiting another 30-60 minutes for dinner. 2 hours was just too long to wait. We ended upstairs which was OK, but not so much for our grandparents we were hosting. Thanks for considering this suggestion.  ",5

7725,I think the guys both on land as well as on the boat could be a bit more welcoming. Also there was no intro or whatsoever given before we took off while the water was rather rough on the way to the island. It doesn't really feel as if they thought safety through. Also it doesn't harm to tell people to not bring small kids if safety can't be assured. So these are points I found not very positive and explain the score. ,6

9152,The location is beautiful and the spirits were great - however the guide/taster (Cameron) spoke WAYY too quickly & didn't read his audience well. It also did not feel like an inclusive experience because he stood behind the bar the entire time. It just felt a little odd. The experience was definitely not worth the amount paid... ,3

I feel like it's starting to trend in the direction of too commercialized. Make sure you keep the culture in place that makes it so great to visit the distillery.

3232,"Review Valtournative The Flame: Fallas Insider Tour We (couple, 30/28, german) took the “The Flame: Fallas Insider Tour” of Valtournative with Daniel and his brother David on the St. Josephs day, 19th March, final and main day of the Fallas de Valencia and can absolutely recommend it! General tour info: On this 4h tour you will get an insight in the valencian tradition of Fallas, its heritage and the different habits (flower offering, masclettas, fallas queens, fallas clubs, and many more). The tour starts at estacion del norte and covers the area of Ruzafa and ends near estacion del norte again to watch the 2 PM-fireworks at placa de ayuntamento. The price of 49€ is reasonable and includes some buñuelos and hot chocolate, a drink as well as the entrance to one falla. In detail: After leaving the train station, Daniel and David took us to the area of Ruzafa and explained the background of the Fallas festivities. We went inside the 2nd place Falla and got detailed explanations on the meaning of the single ninots, what scandals they made fun of – things you will never get as a foreigner! As every Fallas is special there is no need to explain in more detail here – it will be different next year. And that is what makes it special. As the guides English is excellent we had no problems at all to follow their explanations. Afterwards we met a friend of Daniel, Nick, an Englishmen that moved to Valencia and is now member in a local Fallas club. Nick explained his own Falla and showed us around his neighborhood, his club house, the workshop where they built their Fallas and we got some drinks there. I think this was the most special insight to the Fallas on this tour. Everything else you can get also as a usual tourist (but you will only see it and not get the meaning). In the end we turned to placa de ayuntamento and watched the massive day-time firework mascletta there. Daniel gave some recommendation which other Fallas to visit on our own. Further recommendations: For VIPs (very interested people) the Fallas museum near the city of arts and sciences is open all year round and shows the ninots from the last 80 years. Worth seeing! (According to Valtournative website they also offer a pre-Fallas tour from 1st till 10th of March.)   Review Valtournative Hot Springs Tour We (couple, 30/28, german) took the “Hot Springs Tour” of Valtournative with Daniel in Mid-March and can absolutely recommend it!  The short version: 80€ for a 7h tour including swimming in a wonderful place, drinks and snacks, informative conversation on cultural habits and lots of invaluable memorable photographs are well-spent money. If you have the time during your stay in Valencia, do it! General tour info: All-in-all the tour took 7.5 h, total driving time was ~2.5 h. (I don’t really like going by car, but this trip was actually nice! Daniel explained a lot on local culture, habits and other stuff taking our minds off.) Daniel picked us up at our accommodation and drove with us north to the Montanejos springs (region of Castellón). We were the only two people on this particular tour, what made it extra-special.One might also mention that Daniels English is excellent - I think I even improved my speaking during this tour! In detail: ---Spoiler Alert: You will read everything we did on the Hot Springs Tour! If you like to have a little surprise, skip the detailed section and just take the tour! Its worth it! --- First stop were the waterfalls of Navajas/Navaixes with a little love story and scenic photoshooting, followed by a stop in a local tabern including meeting the townships major for a little explanation on the towns name (that was just a coincidence). Main attractions of this tour were the hot springs (25°C) of Montanejos, an ancient Arabian bath, we had never heard of before. Apparently not many people ever heard of it, as very few tourists were there. Daniel was well prepared with wetsuits and shoes (water got colder down the lake, it was good having them on), some toys for playing in the water and a water-proof camera. After enjoying the scenery for a while, he took us down the lake to some even beautiful places which shall not be spoiled here – go there and see for yourself (but check out “montanejos” via google to get an impression of the scene). Afterwards we went for lunch in a nearby tabern with very good Tapas and local wine. Daniel knows the staff well and can recommend the best menues on the card. In the afternoon we went further north to the dam lake near La Poblad’Arenos (Embassamentd’Arenos) that hides a small township buried under water (and maybe a monster?). Nearby we spotted wild mountain goats and went for more water action (bring some extra cloths if you want to go near the dam lakes outlet ;) ) with some funny picture photoshooting. Attach photo hereThis was the last stop of our tour and we turned back to Valencia. Famous last words: After you have explored the city of Valencia with its beautiful Turia Park, Malvarossa beach, places and squares, we recommend taking a day off in the beautiful nature side of the region of Castellon. The price is totally reasonable for this kind of tour, including everything from pick-up service, food, drinks, to bathing equipment, not to forget the always-friendly staff of Valtournativ. Thank you Daniel for this very special day! ",10
61199,Very Nice tour! Very good beer!,9

Die Historie Prags wird anschaulich erzählt, beginnend von Karl IV. über den Kommunismus bis zur Gründung der Tschechischen Republik.  Tipps zum Überleben in Prag, wo man für wenig Geld essen kann und was man sonst so wissen muss hatte Lucie parat und auch sonst konnte sie alle möglichen Fragen zu Prag beantworten! Stationen sind unter Anderem der Wenzelsplatz, die Astronomische Uhr, der Altstädter Ring, der Pulverturm, das Prager Gemeindehaus/Repräsentanzhaus, die St. James Kirche, die spanische Synagoge, die altneue Synagoge, der alte jüdische Friedhof und das Rudolfinum.

40898,"I have been on at least 5 tours with Wild Turkey. The quality of this one was well below the others, which are hit an miss anyway. I had a friend with me from Texas and I explained more than the tour guide. The requirements for Bourbon were barely touched on.

14647,"it was quite loud when two tours crossed over in the bar area making it challenging to hear the tour guide (although he spoke loudly).   I was expecting to see the machinery in operation ...or a bit more of a demonstration...the tour started a few minutes later and after 45 minutes from the booked time, still had not quite ended.  WE had to get to the train station and had to leave.  ",6

14670,THE Tour guide was excellent and the overall experience was very cool. We really enjoyed it!,10
11471,"I think the Heritage Center is superb.  After having been there several times, I still choose a 9.  The only thing I would add would be a few more interactive items for various ages. ",9

41206,Absolutely enjoyable and interesting tour. Our guide was prepared for all our questions and made our visit absolutely remarkable.  ,9
58941,"Great tour, would have liked if at least one of the stallions were brought out for us to see rather than just seeing them behind the fences of their paddock. Would have been nice if the tour guide had some kind of microphone or something, as we were walking some at the front of the group were asking questions and those of us in the back couldn't hear the answers. If no microphone, at least wait until everyone is stopped and repeat the question and then answer. I would have liked to hear what all she was saying.",8
14688,"Perrine was an excellent guide - informative, friendly and funny, she made the tour really interesting and was able to answer all our questions about the history and culture of Budapest.

11689,"Loved the brewery loved the tour. Enjoyed learning about the history and being from the city I'm proud of the brewery and it's history. The only reason it's not a 10 is that I personally don't think of any brewery or beer as ""perfect"" so a 9 is as high as I can go, but in that sense the 9 is basically a 10 from me. All that being said anchor brewery is the brewery I most highly recommend. Cheers! And keep up the fine craft, we know you will.",9

11767,"Incredible people, incredible jump, incredible view and incredibly fast fall.",10
7777,"During the tour, someone started brewing equipment making it too hard to hear the tour guide.  If you're going to offer scheduled tours, you should make accommodations for that.  Even after the equipment stopped running, there was loud music playing on the floor of the brewery.  The tour guide yelled for someone to turn it down but nobody responded.  Highly unprofessional.  Just because the tour is free doesn't mean you should waste people's time with these amateur mistakes.",1
39109,Wow great tour!,9

39156,We had a lot of fun. It was very interesting to learn about Brooklyn brewery’s history and the beer was great. ,10
7778,"Our tour guide was extremely knowlegable, far beyond a standard brewery tour guide (much more in line with someone on the production side of the brewing). He both understood how to present such a vast brewing history that Anchor has, but could also throw in plenty of nuggets for those well-versed in the brewing industry. While I'm sure he will be missed, I hope the rest of your tour guides have the passion for your company and its production that he has.",10

16521,Stephen was a great tour guide,10
16537,"I was not able to attend due to traffic and a flat tire.

11913,"Boat as newer and well designed compared with previous trips we have done with other operators. Food good quality, though only white wine and that ran out half way through the day. This was only bad point. Good crew, Rudy Scott and Pasquale",9
11921,"We weren't sure what to expect so had gone fairly open-minded and were really pleased with the event. Celia is great, very personable and happy to answer any questions as you go through the morning.  Highly recommend, especially if you're foodies!",10

12075,thought I'd see more about production,4
12030,AWESOME!,10
12055,Very informative! General overview of brewing process and differences between ales and lagers would have been helpful though. I had to explain those things myself to the rest of my party that was not quite as beer savvy,9
11924,"We were a small group and Jared did an excellent job of engage us all during the tour, explaining the history and providing insight on the many type of Anchor brews!",10

12045,Well- we were really impressed with how much was going on that you allowed us to see in a safe and organized building.  Keep up the good work!,10
12092,Need better Asimo exhibit. InterActive display not very impressive.  Also needs to be adjusted downward to work for small children.    The robot that does welding and painting etc was a huge hit.   Also the interactive video helmet for driving needs a stand so shorter users can use it.   Formula 1 car needs to be moved  to the the entrance. Very cool.  ,9
3527,We had an amazing guide and driver who was so knowledgeable about Ecuador and the area. Such a great experience! We will be doing a trip advisor review as well! Thank you so much!,10
3530,Great beer and an awesome atmosphere. The food was also terrific. ,10
12049,Gramvousa and Balos was nice day trip target. The bus was very good and the athosphere at the boat was very holiday mode🤠 Food was also good at the boat.   The guide could tell something about those faboulous nature atraction,9
16508,Celia is a very knowledgeable lady and a mine of information. She shares this freely and in a very personable way. A great way to get to know a new area of London & to learn about foods & tastes I would not necessarily have thought of trying before. Thanks for a brilliant morning!,9
16596,Pleasant guides.,8

12061,"I had a great time, learned a few things (Like what does CVCC mean?) and even took a few photos.  I brought my ""car buddy"" from California just as a way to return the favor of museums we've visited when I was there.  Was NOT expecting this to be as cool as it was. ",10

12131,small groups and actually walking the floor.  Saw how safety and zero defects were being implemented.,10
12174,Beer is bad,2
12170,"Damian ensured that the tour met our expectations, and from our first to last communication was friendly, professional and provided a great experience. His knowledge of wine and viticulture along with Argentinian and Uruguayan history and culture made for a fascinating, informative and fun day out to Carmelo and Colonia.",10
12198,"Paid tour was no more impressive than the standard, free, open to the public walk through tour. Not worth taking a day off of work for just for the 'in-depth' tour. Amazing beer as expected but tour was underwhelming compared to those of other brewery peers of this size.",4
42694,"The tour was very good and Bubba was a blast as the tour guide, very informative. Impressive facility",9
42712,Vivian was a great tour guide and the visitor's centre is a beautiful facility ,10
44376,Paid for the Bud Light tour & did not find value in the extra cost.  Limited & quick viewing of Clydesdales & tour guides talked very quickly.  ,5
12167,We had a fantastic time and Daniel was very accommodating. I'd highly recommend. ,10
39116,ok,10

12144,"The tour is extremely informative, and engaging. The Heritage Center presents the products in a historical context. If anything, they're presented with great modesty. But that's kind of the point of Honda. Excellence with modesty. ",10
16599,Just AMAZING !!!,10
39162,The tour guide was very knowledgeable and entertaining.,9
3544,I didn't care for the beer. My friend ordered the roasted chicken and it was a teeny tiny bird. The tour guide was very nervous and difficult to follow. ,1
3543,The guide knows his stuff,10
3586,"Favourite parts were learning about the history of the company; learning about the varieties of beer; tasting the different versions; and seeing the production. For some reason, we were rushed through the production line very quickly and had no chance to see what was going on. From that point forward, the tour guide was in a foul mood so that was a downer. As a suggestion, Anchor really should archive its history in a book. It's a great story and would even make a fascinating case study in business school.",9
12033,,10
17826,Mike the tour guide was great and the tour is a great way to learn the story behind my favorite beer,10
3561,I was expecting to see more on how the beer is processed. The manufactury running.,5

39118,kujn.kjn.,7
61212,"Too much focus on the stallions, stud fees and who was out of whom by whom.  I would have enjoyed learning more about  the farm's operations and perhaps seeing a few mares and foals. Tour group was also too large.",2

3583,"We really loved this tour. We've been on a lot of brewery tours, but this one stood out as both informative and fun (a lot of them aren't so fun!).

3601,very nice place with kind people... 😊,10
3599,Stephan was an excellent tour guide! ,10
12209,"Great tour.  Wish there was a different offering of merchandise. I know things change and styles differ, but was surprised I didn't feel more of a connection with any of the shirts / sweatshirts. for example I would prefer solid colors - normal fabrics for hoodies. I would wear a hoodie like that everyday. The sweatshirts that were available did. It meet that requirement for me. Didn't look like everyday durable wear that I like. ",8
12223,"Great staff, great beer, informative tour!!",10

12126,"The staff were very informative, patient with everyone's questions and often even pretty darned funny. ;-)  Having worked at HMA I was very impressed. Whenever I thought, ""hey, how come they didn't talk about <something>"", don't you know it, they would talk about just that. Very thorough!  I'm very impressed and especially pleased to have this so close to our home in Hilliard, OH.  Thanks and keep up the good work!",10

14799,James was a great tour guide! He was loud & clear & very informative! He encouraged questions & answered fully anything that I asked him. He even invited any of us to lunch with him at a authentic restaurant. We liked James so much we booked the castle tour with him in the afternoon! ,10

39121,We had a bus load of people and were unfortunately 10 minutes late. They would not add us in the back end of the tour nor refund us the money. They did offer us to sit for 40 minutes and wait for the tasting. At least Woodford was crazy busy they were able to work us in. ,2
14798,"The tour gave a interesting history of the brewery, reflecting the history of SF.  I learned what makes Anchor beers different from the other beers and how much the staff cares about what they are making. Thank you.",10

45937,Tour guide was friendly and informative. ,10
61186,"Olivia was exceptional at her delivery of content in all ways!  Her voice was clear, concise, and energetic.  Her stories of all the horses and the farm were engaging and dynamic and drew the fan into the farm as a whole.  We were so appreciative to have the extended tour and learned so much more than we did 5 years ago when we visited the farm for the first time.  Thank you, WinStar, for being such a leader in the industry for us fans.  Olivia, kudos to you!  We WILL be back to do this tour again down the road.

17359,"i have *already* recommended it to several friends here in Lima and elsewhere in Peru and also posted on my FB page. I wish to write a RAVE review. Here's why: First off, every communication I had with your company was professional, clear and followed up in a speedy way. I had originally booked with another company (a link that popped up when I booked my hotel) but I had to cancel due to a change in my work schedule. That company didn't have tours for the days I was available, so I went searching for another tour and found your company. I booked the ""Lovely Barranco y Miraflores"" tour. However, I got a message saying that I was the only one booked and asking would I be interested in changing to a different tour/time? However, this was when I was available, but I said that I understood if you needed to cancel. I was informed by Fabiana (and later Chris) that they decided there was ""no way"" they would cancel it, even if it meant going sloe with the guide and luckily, by the time of the tour, 3 more people signed up as well. When I arrived at the shop I was greeted like a favorite cousin, or long lost best friend.  Rony (sp?) led us skillfully through the streets of Miraflores and Barranco and showed us amazing ""rincones y callecitas."" While having ""algo para tomar en un cafe,"" we met up with Chris and his group and all rode back to the shop together. I have come here every August for work for the last 4 years, and this was the MOST fun thing I have done for sure. Every single piece of this trip was fantastic. In fact, I went back again today and rented a bike to go back and explore some more. I have to say though, that while that was very fun, it didn't compare to Rony's fantastic tour and the great fun of making new friends from Scotland, Chile and Peru. Thank you all for such a fabulous tour. Please feel free to post any part of this review on your website as a review. ¡Lima Bike Rental Tours es fenomenal! Mil gracias! L. Holland",10

15409,"I had heard so much about the tour in advance and how fun and quirky it was and was disappointed that it wasn't really funny and the stations weren't that unique - very old soaking jalapenos for one thing.  Guide was ""nice"" but just wasn't that fun.  Tasting room bar person was much funnier - so probably would skip the tour next time if someone from out of town were inclined to visit.",1
16772,Guides wee extremely nice and interesting. Ride/scenery was a little less dramatic than expected. ,8
139945,Danny was great. Would have give 10 if we could have tasted all the beers available. Time was limited and only got to try about 4. ,8
71107,Great in depth tour.  Our guide was so personable and also very knowledgeable.  Sorry to hear ours was the last tour weekend of the year.  We really enjoyed it.,10
15152,"The trip was awesome but i rated it with a 8 because of the fact that the lunch was not included in the price. That would be better because it already is a pretty expensive trip and because of that i kind of expected it that the lunch was included. The tour itself was perfect! We had a blast! Thankyou Daniel for the lovely day and all your stories! Kind regards from Shehnaaz and Daphne from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. ",8

23558,"I think there should be less tours that are more informative.  You have made it like Disney, just shuffling people through, and the $10 discount is off of top end retail prices after the tour.   I could have bought a bottle at my local shop for $39 prior to driving in.   It was more with the $10 discount.  Make people feel like they get a ""deal"" and not just you making more money off loyal followers. ",3
115645,The tour was good. We got to see a lot of animals. But it was strenuous kayaking. I haven’t kayaked before so had no clue about the work involved. I wouldn’t recommend it if you are looking for a relaxing way to enjoy the mangroves. But if you like Kayaking you may enjoy it more.,5

3866,"It was a great experience!  So much fun, people were helpful and kind. Macao beach is an amazingly beautiful place! Only criticism would be that we were too close together and as a result I was injured and couldn't finish out my time.  I was struck with my partners surf board not my own.",10

17377,Our tour was informative and gave us a good impression of the processing of olive oil. We really appreciate being able to imagine the path from the tree to the bottle.,8
3925,I was terrified once I started Zipping.  Jorge was awesome and zipped with me the rest of the course.  I cant tell you how appreciative I was. ,10

3928,Enjoyable class and great clubs to visit after. ,8
3920,It was a great tour and quite informative,10
35986,Comfortable bed. Spacious room. Dinner was good. Service at the bar and in the restaurant was very good. Location at the station was good. We were in a rush at breakfast so were a bit frustrated when we had to chase up the coffee and realised that it had not been made yet.  Did not like the shower over the bath or the hand wash body wash and shampoo in one single half filled dispenser. Probably 8 out of 10 was a more accurate rating of how we felt about the hotel. I would recommend it.,6
17886,The craziest experience of my lifetime!!,10
3961,The Tour was great and very informative. Our Tour guide Lia actively answered all our questions. Will recommend the Tour to my Freinds :),10
17868,"Quick emailresponse. Your pickup was 10 min. early! 😃 Ckean, nice catamaran. Lovely crew! Excellent food. The  weather was terrible, nothing you can do about that. BUT!! Since the weather was ALREADY BAD IN THE MORNING YOU SHOULD HAVE CANCELLED THE TRIP. We were only 2 familys anboard so if you would have called us in the morning and asked us we both would have cancelled and picked another day to go. Today for an example. 😃 But the crew did their best to keep us happy in the pouring rain! ",10
25223,"To be fair, I'd give your 2014 Snowflake a 8.5 out of 10 based on the wonderful palate and extremely fair price (albeit difficult to get).  Overall, Stranahan's is a truly unique whiskey and I recommend that any whisk(e)y drinker at least try the original.  I fully appreciate what you're doing and feel that you make a high quality product.  But, my palate is honestly a bit confused by the original and diamond peak malts that you currently offer and that's why I haven't made it a staple at home.  I'm a scotch drinker and started exploring bourbon about 2 years ago.  The original contains the sweet, smooth, creaminess that I like in a bourbon, but throws me with the peppery tone at the end that.  The diamond peak is simply too peppery for me and distracts me from the subtler flavors that I enjoy in a scotch.  It reminds me of a few notes in Talisker, but magnified a bit more than I like.  All of this said, I'm very excited to try the sherry finished malt that you're working on and I hope that it may land on my shelf at home.  Keep up the good work and chive on!",6

18186,"Mike, our guide was very informative and theatrical and he kept the group interested in everything he talk about. 10 star for Mike! ",10
40335,Took the $10 Bud Light tour with two friends and we loved it! The guide was thorough but not winded. The tour itself was long enough to see plenty but not so long it got boring or old. And the beer was delish!  ,10

18139,"The tour was good but it would of been better if we were able to see the line working and everyone doing their jobs which I was not aware previous to the tour that it was cleaning day on fridays.

41056,"Tour was missing people that could explain the actual facts of brewing,  the operations of the biggest brewery,  and how you do it. The buildings and history were good, but I don't want to be taken to a horse for 20 minutes of my tour, or hold a piece of Beachwood with no real substance to the brewing process. Lagunita could share some tips on a tour that blows you away. I was told how great the tour was and was so disappointed for the biggest brewery. ",5
39174,It was very interesting reading the history on the wall. Finding out that so many family members are so involved with the distillery was very nice to hear. I think Bo (and he’s right never forget his name) did a great job on the tour. He was able to answer all questions and did a great job explaining the process of making the bourbon. The tasting was interesting as Bo explained how real tasters would drink the bourbon. I myself have never been a bourbon drinker. My husband enjoys it almost every evening but I walked away with the appreciation of learning so much and even found something for me. I am one of your newest drinkers of American Honey. Thank you so much for a great day!,10
41180,It was cool but breweries are just breweries,3

24303,Very frendly and informatish. Couldn't do enough for us. We got our booking dates mixed up and they were more than helpful and layed on a nother tour for us. Its good to see someone doing things the traditionally and not letting money rule there hearts.,10
18635,"As you know from Gina at Blue Adventure Divers, the rebooking with Tellus went terribly. They rented me an old car with no gas that ran out of gas less than 1 km from the pickup location. Police came. Not the best vacation experience. ",1

Wasn't overly impressed!",5

41029,Better than the Christmas party!,10
18689,"Love the beer, love the brewery. Too much time is spent listening and taking ""drinking lessons"". It was all good info, but should be condensed in half, with more time at the end to use and spend tokens.   Also, I don't understand, we were told if we don't spend all our tokens we can come back, but the lady at the token booth woudl not allow a friend to spend a token. I completely understand some of the rules, like closed toed shoes, etc, but who is allowed to spend tokens and drink the beer, versus who is not, just doesn't make sense. ",5

24368,"The tour was for someone who knows little about beer, although to be fair, the tour leader was very knowledgeable and could answer questions.  The problem is that someone wanting more information would not want to ask a lot of questions on a group tour.",5
24260,"Great tour, easy going guide and many great laughs. And the beer was awesome.",10

23843,We thoroughly enjoyed our day.  The reason we only gave 9 out of 10 was due to the problems with payment method.  The web site states the charge is £75pp. When paying there is a further transaction fee. There is nothing to state that the transaction is being carried out in dollars and could cause even further charges. In the end I was refunded most of the charge. If booking an English tour quoted as £75pp that is what you expect the cost to be.  However this did not spoil a lovely day.   ,10
115701,Margaret was great she was knowledgeable personable receptive to questions and had all the answers we really enjoyed our tour,10

24453,The product is superb especially the XO. The young lady who showed us round on the 11.30 visit was brilliant I don't know what you pay her but it's not enough. The award winning barman was also excellent. All in all very enjoyable morning.,10
24454,Our guide Gemma was good and friendly. Parking was easy. The group was a little too big.  The shop could not give us a tax refund form but still asked for money for a small plastic bag. All in all a good experience.,7

24490,The guide Vaclav was awesome,10
32132,"We had a big group come in and the employee checking us in ( I think his name was Westin) was pretty rude. Because it was such a large group and not everyone showed up at the same time, some people didn't check in right away since we got pre-occupied greeting one another. This clearly annoyed your employee and he spoke to us like we idiots and an inconvenience. Through his attitude, my first impression of Stranahans is one that is pretentious. We also had a friend who showed up late ( his uber driver got lost), but that same guy that checked us all in did not let him join the tour, so he waited for us by himself in the gift shop until the tour was over. He already paid for the tour, which isn't the issue, perhaps its company policy not to allow people to come back to the distillary after the tour has begun, which is fine, but a clear explanation was not provided as to why he couldn't join late. Instead, our friend said that the employee was rude to him, just said he was late and he can't go back and didn't give him a reason why he couldn't take him back to join in the remainder of the tour. First impressions are everything and that single employee was enough for me to not drink or recommend Stranahans. ",4
24493,"Great tour guide, lots of interesting history and very organised.",8

24577,The tour was a gift from colleagues. They said that they rated it very highly. Yet I did not know quite what to expect. I should have taken note of the title of Gastrotour. It was exactly that.

31645,"I showed up for to the tour late. I knew I was late and I thought I missed the entire tour. But, I could see the group through the glass and I asked the guy with shorter hair on the sides, almost like a mohawk, if I could join the group since I had already paid. He laughed and said, ""for the 7:00 tour? Ha, I couldn't let you in there even if I wanted to."" So.....he was telling me that he didn't want to help me. So, I sat alone until the tour was finished. I would have been fine with not joining the tour, but he was a complete assshole about it. I work a stressful job and have to deal with assholes everyday. I don't want to deal with them when I'm paying for it. I will never go to Stranahan's again. Thank you",0

18790,"The tour guide was warm, informative, and spoke clearly/loudly so we could all hear. The group size could have been a bit smaller to make it easier to maneuver. The samples were a great size and the water pitcher was appreciated. The tour entrance could have had better signage to distinguish it. We wandered a bit before we found the door. ",9

18902,"From the beginning there was great communication in a timely manner.  Comfortable riding accommodations.  Danny was very good at getting everyone to talk to get to know each other.  The success of any tour is the relationship between the guest and playing off their personalities.  He was also very knowledgeable, I am that person who enjoys knowing what is around me, when I asked the random off beat questions (thank you for entertaining the nerd side of me) the sites themselves were beautiful, wish there was ,ore time to hike around the dam but I know I can always go back.

25358,Ramesh was a fantastic guide. Sandip was also very good as assistant guide and Buddha was a great porter. The mountain experience was amazing.  Only thing I would say is to suggest on the website/via email catching a flight not a bus from Pokhara to Kathmandu And Kathmandu to Pokhara. It takes many hours longer than what it says on the website. ,10

25534,"The guide was awesome, porters were great, the company took care of everything from trekking poles and sleeping bags to transportation and hotel rooms. The only suggestion I would make is that the last days of the trek are very hard in comparison, and might benefit from two extra days to break them up. But maybe more sportive trekkers don't have that same problem...",8
24484,Did a walking tour and castle tour with Vaclav and the Terezim Concentration Camp tour with Lucie. All tours were excellent. Both tour guides were exceptionally knowledgeable. Vaclav had a great sense of humour that we really enjoyed. Would highly recommend this company. ,10

The tour was informative, but the supposition was juvenile. ",5

41656,"Nepal Eco Adventure offers an outstanding trekking experience. From the outset the owner, Cchatra was extremely efficient, helpful and organized an excellent trekking experience for me. Nothing was too much trouble and he delivered exactly what was agreed upon. My guide Bijay was outstanding. He was kind, caring, funny, knowledgeable and he had binoculars to ensure we could see birds, reliable, responsible, reminding me that at all times my safety was  paramount. Gokyo Renjo Pass was incredible and the scenery spectacular. Without hesitation, I highly recommend Nepal Eco Adventure for a professional trekking experience in which both Cchatra and Bijay went the extra mile ensuring a wonderful trekking experience. It is rare not to be able to find one fault but on this holiday arranged brilliantly no fault can be found.",10

71115,"Beautiful facility, friendly and knowledgeable staff (Mike did a great tour!), oh and awesome beer!",10
26323,The guides weren't very good at English. We didn't have the same guide through our 3 days. The quality of the food was fine but the amount of it was a bit small. The free water was not cold. The rooms were a bit dirty but it was nice with the mosquito nets. The tours were great but we could easily spend more time on Monkey Island.  ,5

43785,Any person that likes beer needs to know about Anchor Brewing and it’s influence on craft beer. Beer lovers newer to the scene generally have less of a historical appreciation for breweries that have influenced their favorite beers. The greater understanding they have the more they’lll be able to appreciate the present. Our Anchor tour guide provided a great historical account of steam beer and Fritz Maytag’s fateful move to purchase the company. ,10
26438,"I loved the Favela Tour with Patrick.  He guided us expertly through the neighborhood, and educated us little bit on life on a favela.  I loved the colorful artwork on the walls of the buildings.  It was one of the highlight of my time in Rio. ",10

124070,"Beautiful location, well maintained and friendly tour guide. Disappointed that we did not see AP but understand that this happens. Main reason was to see JUSTIFY and that was awesome. I drove from Buffalo New York and my husband and I loved the tour. Justify has been a beautiful horse to watch and saw him win Derby and Triple Crown. Can not wait to come back next year. many thanks....Liza Pane",10

26442,Brewpub was tiny and the staff was overwhelmed. The brew tour was quick and average. Nothing special on the pub only beer menu. All in all an average visit. I still like many of the GI beer offering.,4

39084,"It is an awesome tour.  Second time for me..  You get to sample a few beers along the way..  Liove the finishing room getting to sample beer out of ^00.000 gallon tank. It also helps that Michelob Golden is my favorite beer.  AB has such a history, but hate was purchased by foreigner.  Alex our Troy guide was great.  ",10

But at the beer factory near tanks and machines, I couldn't catch all the words there even though the speaker was speaking very loudly...And If you sell chips or small dishes in the bar, I could have enjoyed the tour more...But anyway, in general, I enjoyed the tour so much...Thanks a lot!",7
42441,Our Tour and Tour Guide were terrible. We came all the way from Tennessee and Alabama and were very disappointed. Out tour was Sunday at 2:00pm.,1
42718,"Bubba our tour guide, did a fantastic job. The info that he gave was great.",10
43301,We liked the fact that it is a relatively small destillery and we ended up having a private tour since nobody else signed up for a 10:30am tour. Our guide was very passionate about the whisky and answered all our questions.,10
955,"This tour was very informative and entertaining. Tour guide Karen really made it personal, discussing how it came to be right from the beginning. Highly recommend this tour - and if Karen isn't your guide you should ask for her.",8
956,The tour is worth every penny but I won't spoil the surprises. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and it's good whiskey too!,9
26391,Because the Spanish tour didn't exist and you didn't notice me about this. We were at the meeting point and nobody was there! The first day we where at 10 and we received a message at 10 (!!) telling me the tour was cancelled. The second try was worse. We were at 10 am and nobody told us anything about a cancellation. Disastrous!,0

41959,It would have been nice to see the actual bottling up closer and to see the aluminum can process. I am not even sure cans are done there. It also would have been nice to see the packing process too. ,10
42442,"The tour was interesting, our tour leader really knew his stuff and he seemed like he really enjoyed his job. The beers were great and I enjoyed learning the different interesting facts about what makes Anchor special.",10
26602,"Flexibility.  Rescheduled my booking to the time suit me.  The more important is we were late for an hour that day and they still allow me to play.    However, the departure point is extremely difficult to find.  Even with GPS, we could not find it.  I suggest you'd better attach a map in very small scale showing the landmark at nearby.",5
26508,"When it comes to being introduced to a city, it makes a huge difference if the guide is passionate about their job and Lucie has that in spades - what a legend!",10
19231,"Generous samples, knowledgeable tour guides, excellent facilities, easy access",10
19220,"We were told to arrive 15 min early (which we did) but our tasting started 15 minutes late. This meant we were stuck standing around in a hot tiny lobby for 30 minutes. Once our tasting did start, the tasting instructor didn't do a good job of actually guiding us through the tastings. She talked and talked but it wasn't always clear what she was trying to say. It was also unclear when the tasting was complete and what we should do next--our group wound up making what felt like an awkward exit because the tasting seemed to be over, but we weren't actually sure what was happening. Overall: disorganized, not super fun. ",0
39280,Everyone was super friendly and the tour was great. Bubba was our tour guide and he was wonderful!! ,10
40385,10 suggest no room for improvement.  I hope Wild Turkey keeps making a great experience even better.. Met Jimmy Russell talked about Bourbon and football.,9

61251,Awesome place and experience. ,10
19215,Because we are from Sothern California and don't know that many people who come up to San Francisco. Also we went on a Saturday and the bottling line wasn't running.,9
26547,We had a fantastic tour. Braden our tour guide was very informative and a real character. Sampling all the different beers was brilliant. All the people in the brewery  were very friendly. It's is a must do tour for anyone visiting San Francisco and likes their beers.,10
26536,"We really enjoyed the tour and the Heritage Center.  Our only suggestion was that the time allotted for the museum was too long, and people had finished looking and were sitting around waiting until 11 am. Maybe start the museum portion of the tour 15 minutes later, say 9:45 am.  I'm a big Honda fan so it was good to see how the cars are made.  THANKS ",10
26537,Heather was great. i loved the tour.,9
41533,Bubba made the tour. He is just good people!,10
19208,"Horribly planned- time wasn't a factor. Guide was dismissive, rude, and didn't watch out for the tour participants. Noted dietary restrictions and had incredibly disappointing breakfast (only fruit while everyone else had full meal). Weather was dangerous and guide didn't adjust at all- putting everyone in danger. Van was ill equipped - horrible diesel smell, and no heat - driver also drove recklessly. ",0
42443,"It was a rainy day, but we really enjoyed seeing the facility and the museums and learning about the history of the campus.  Our guide was great and easy to talk with.  We took the 10:10 am tour on Tuesday, March 26.  Would have loved to see more of the ""working stables"".   The Biergarten is great and every employee we encountered was very pleasant and accommodating!  Thank you!  ",10

26551,We had a great time and had a lot of fun ,10
26598,The lady giving the tour was very knowledgeable and excited about the product! However spoke so fast it made her very difficult to understand- and we are first language English! The Brewery tour could have been longer and more explanation given - we couldn't hear about the process! Had a great time it was amazing to try your other beers that we don't see in the UK! I love the pumpkin! ,7
26497,Tour is very basic and the presenter did add very little in knowledge. He was more about making jokes. Tasting beer was nice but I expected something more interesting that would add knowledge to me.,3

In addition I would like to express our gratitude with regard to the plane tickets/refund Lisette & Frits",9
24371,"Patryk was a great teacher, very friendly and patient, very talented and fun. He made us feel welcome and taught us a lot. It's very good value for money, as the taxi, class and entry would have all added up. Thank you so much for a great time! :) ",10

5963,"Тур оказался увлекательным. Основной гид Лия работает в Terra Creta много лет и знает все нюансы производства. В итоге экскурсия получается живой и познавательной. Разузнали много интересного: какие масла вредны для здоровья, а какие полезны; на каком масле лучше жарить, а какое лучше в салат; на что обращать внимание при выборе масла. На производстве прошли процесс от приема оливок до получения масла, а потом попробовали различные виды дегустационном зале. Для ценителей здесь есть элитные виды масла: органическое, с низкой кислотностью (0.2%), оливки раннего сбора и т.п.

14079,We had a very friendly and informative tour of the facility and all my questions and more where answered by the Mill Magager Kostas. The tasting session at the end was also very nice and we where pleasantly surprised at the different flavour profiles of the different Olive Oil.   There is a great range of Oils to chose from and although they are more expensive than some you can find locally you really do get what you pay for and we where happy to pay. ,10
58991,N/A,10
26733,"Nice content, but nothing really dark there. Even worse the fact that a bunch of bloggers where attached to the group and dominated the whole tour, asking stupid questions and streaming live most of it, ruined the whole experience. By the way they were there for free, while we paid a quite substantial fee for a three hours walk. The only reason you score a 5, is that the guide, Emma, really tried to balance the whole thing and did her best, unfortunately that was not enough. ",5

26715,"Ashley was a great tour guide, and all the samples were delicious!   Only downside was we didn't plan a day when the bottle line was up and running! Would love to see the line in action, live, but we did get to see a video of it!  Thank you!  It was a great way to celebrate our 16 year anniversary!",9

26740,"My two friends & I had a great time, it was much more interesting than we actually anticipated. Jon, our guide for the tour, was very informative, & funny when it was unexpected; he's a great asset to your company. The 90 minute tour seemed to go much quicker, probably because it was so informative & interesting. Thanks so much!!",10

19427,"Tour guide was great, beer good and glad to hear that the beer is actually made there!",10
26787,"Braden gave us a great tour combining the history of Anchor Brewing and the beer making process. The tour and tasting was great fun.  Love hearing about all beers, new and old. ",10
26728,Our tour guide was pleasant & fun! Had a taste ready before the tour! Tasting was well done - sorry the pub wasn't open yet! Trying to find Anchor on tap near 12065! Great Beer!  Thanks! ,10
39368,Great guide ,10
26719,Always liked Honda's and their innovative engine technology.  Liked the engine displays. Had several Hondas and Acuras over the years over the years including an identical 1987 CRX Si (red in color) exhibited at the Heritage Center.,10

43313,"Bubba was a fantastic tour guide, plus Wild Turkey is delicious.",10
64428,This farm is so nice and the horses there are as well. It’s really something you have to witness at least once in your lifetime. The guide was so nice and we even got to go on the property in an electric tour cart. The guide made sure we had enough time to enjoy everything. Well done!,10
42149,"The tour guide was great! He was very personable and funny. He was well-informed and able to answer all questions. He let the tour kind of dictate how things went. For example, our group really enjoyed the stables so he let us stay there a little longer. It was a great time. I will be back! ",10
42724,We missed our bus for the tour but enjoyed the history wall and the tasting. We will be back. ,10
43566,"Except for the fact that it was very cold, something entirely uncontrollable, John gave us lots of great info. It was neat getting to meet a Kentucky Derby winner (Orb) up close and personal. Mastery was gorgeous. Lea was a great start, and the stats on War Front...whoa! I went to Kentucky Horse Park the day before and Churchill Downs the day after. Each had different info and things and horses to see, and they complimented each other beautifully. Thanks for the wonderful tour at Claiborne Farm.",10
115647,Jared was an excellent tour guide/ host. He answered all of our questions and was very friendly. The beer was excellent as always. We enjoyed getting to see more of the workings. ,10
43794,Great bourbons but disappointed we didn't get glasses from tasting this year.,10
44240,"10 out of 10 on the tour and Heather was wonderful, knowledgeable and engaging. The employee manning the bar was not super pleasant and mildy judgemental. ",9
26775,"El tour fue muy entretenido y didáctico, un poco largo la introducción, la duración del tour y el largo de la caminata está bien. ",8
41537,Francisco did a great job of finding lots of small animals that we otherwise would have never seen.  Overall a very interesting and worthwhile experience,10
41098,"Due to getting out of our training later than scheduled at the hotel and many streets in St Louis blocked, we were unable to meet our 4:10 ticket time at the brewery and lost out on being able to cancel and reschedule.",0
39369,Tour was great and Jimmy signed my bottle. ,10
26956,"Everything was amazing and I loved it - the tandem, the procedure, the jump, the location, the views - couldn't have been better!   But the only thing that was not in favour for us was the price of the transport to the location. 150€ was way too expensive for us, and especially for those who can't drive or rent a car. ",9
42147,"The tour was conducted by a trainee, and was her first time conducting the full tour.  Most of the time she was reading the info from her phone and the speaker provided was not loud enough to project her voice.  I feel like we did not learn much of anything about bourbon production.  There was an older tour guide who provided instruction during the tasting.  That went well.  I understand that training needs to happen.  This should be an easy fix.  The trainee should go through the facility and memorize the content before being put in front of a group.    Also, when I had come before, a Wild Turkey glass was provided, but that has been done away with.  Not much value in this tour, except the tasting.  If the tour is this bad, it would be better to forego the tour, and pay $6 to taste the bourbon.",0
42151,A bit unorganized. ,7
42294,Very cool time,10

26914,"Had a really fabulous time with my sister in a super group... Celia was so informal, unrushed but completely interesting, interested and kept the paxe flowing effortlessly. A wonderful array of food - beautiful chocolate and cheese shops to start. And ultimately gives you the confidence to step off the main thoroughfare and explore what gems can clearly be found. Thanks for the opportunity to dip into an adjacent world!",10

33838,"This is evaluation of three ordered tours. None of tours met my expectations. Perhaps I had too high expectations, (1) descriptions of tours were very convincing, (2) usually we do sightseeing on our own, and we do it much more intensively than the tour program assumed. Respectively.  Tour guide: Our guide  was fluent in English, and has a very rich vocabulary, but due to her specific pronunciation, I think, we did not understand almost half of the information we were given. But, she was enthusiastic and tried to meet our expectations.  Car and driver - ok  Itinerary MUL-OD 03 (Mandalay-Mingun Tour) 5.01.2018 Mingun – in my opinion, it missed taking a quick look at Pondaw Paya (we did it, aditionaly) Mandalay – (1) the local market of the river bank – no, we visited multi-storey building, mostly with Chinese products; (2) Monastic education – I expected to see novices learning aloud from books in Pali language, not Primary school pupils; (3) explore some handicraft like wooden tubs and bullock cart making – no, there was nothing at all  MUL-OD 02 (Ava-Sagaing-Amarapura Tour) 4.01.2018 Ava – it is unfair, that your tour itinerary has even less than standard horse cart drive for 10000K offered on place (Yedanasimi Paya ruins - missing)  MUL-OD 06 (Morning visit in Mandalay) 3.01.2018 Bad weather and heavy rain spoiled our tour, so no comments ",4
26799,"Excellent talk , funny but interesting. Charming. Lovely staff. Lovely place. Beautiful modern architecture melded with beautiful old buildings. Lovely welcome.

Thank you.",10
58995,I enjoyed the tour.,8
27065,I was with my parents and because of the travel we were all tired. In all fairness we arrived exactly at 2 instead of earlier.  We were spoken to in a very curt manner and told to go to another tour. I insisted we were registered and was told strongly along with 3 others Its too full and to go to the other tour and it’s free.  I,0
27027,The only downside was the over priced soup and sandwiches for the four of us in your cafe - £4.50 for a packet of sandwiches is extremely expensive and felt that we were ripped off. ,9
43068,"I love history, especially about St. Louis.  I live only about a block from the brewery, in an 1890 house, and think it's really cool that you guys have been around even longer than my house.  Great artifacts in the old school house, beautiful brew house, stunning stables, great place to visit. Just one thing, please plant more flowers like you did when the Busch's owned it- it made you look so good!",10

42946,Fun tour,9
42304,"The girl who gave the tour did a great job but I was on the back of the room and it was hard to hear because it was very loud. The history of the brewery and branding process were too long and that made it a little less interesting, I wish there was a bit more of information on the process of each beer as well. ",4
43064,Excellent whiskey,10

43065,We haven't been on the free tour in about 6 years. It was interesting and fun. We liked the 7 ounce free sample at the brew house and the 16 ounce free sample at the end. We will be back.,10
27131,Daniel has gone out of his way and above all that would be expected ,10
61255,"The history told on the tour was really interesting, the atmosphere was great and the wide variety of tastings available at the end was worth every penny. ",9
41542,"I had a group of 32 and had emailed for tickets and told them I would be coming for lunch beforehand. When we arrived the beer garden had no idea we were coming. The food and service was great, but they seemed startled that we arrived and had to delay our tour to accommodate the dinning.",9

42433,It was a great tour with really cool stuff to see!,10
64376,I have toured winstar many times but this was the 1st time on the extended tour. To me it was not worth the extra 10.00 just to ride around the farm. Now if were able to get out and see the mama's and babies up close it might have been worth it. I will tour again but just the stallions. ,7
43337,"I had a great time visiting the farm. I found the tour to be very personable. Getting to listen to stories of horses I grew up watching at the races from various members of the farm's team was a big highlight. Getting to walk through the foaling barn and see where champions were born was great, as well as seeing the new baby who had just been born the night prior to the tour on 3/30. I will definitely be coming back for a visit on a future trip. ",10
44005,This tour was one of the best I have ever been on. We were able to see the stallions and mares and their foals up close. The entire staff was so nice and I would highly recommend this tour to anyone going to KY. Excellent! Can't say enough good things! ,10

27198,Good and informative  guide,9
19389,"We took the Spanish tour and I wouldn't recommend the experience to anyone. First it was difficult to understand the guide since he is not Spanish. Second, i think we would show us things totally irrelevant. The tour was boring.",2
42453,"Tour was I teresting and done well.  The gift shop workers were very friendly and helpful.  They helped with deciding other places to go.  And to top things off, we had the opportunity to visit with Jimmy Russell.",10

43076,It was a good exposure to your facilities and tour is well-designed.,9
6329,"We had an amazing time! Our tour guide was brilliant and really made sure we had a great time! Only criticism was that I got bitten quite a lot my mosquito (which I realize isn't your fault) but for anyone planning on going to take plenty of strong repellent with you as 40+ bites certainly itches the next day. Other than that the pain was definitely worth the pleasure!! Be prepared to get very muddy, dusty and be smiling for days after xx",10
3689,"The guide was funny, totally amazing and showed us the most amazing spots of nature I have ever seen! Thank you for this wonderful opportunity ",10
19492,Carl was clearly very knowledgeable and was able to pass this on in an interesting and on point manner.  Pace was just about right.  It was a fabulous afternoon.,10
4435,"I would definitely recommend this tour to other People. Quad Biking was great fun - we did it the first time and would do it again :-) You can see Areas which you cannot discover by car and bus! All was arranged very well, also the lunch break with the picknick was very nice idea.  If we are in Mauritius again, we will book another tour for sure!!!",10
4781,"Had a great time. Leader was very good (rodney). You supplied masks but goggles would have been EVEN MORE valuable. Warnings should have been provided about the dust, particularly for the eyes. All of our group (four quads) complained about it and it is dangerous/hazardous..",8
25175,The guide seemed bored (he was on his phone a lot) and the differences in abilities meant we went a lot slower than I expected. It also stated two hours but we were finished a quarter of an hour early,5
27867,"The whole quad experience was excellent as we rode all through the sugar cane fields, coast, rum tasting and visit La Vanille Crocodile Park so this was an excellent full day! There were some issues starting with the booking as the website wasn’t very clear as I booked for 2 quad bikes for 4 people to include lunch.  It states how many people for lunch and it only gave u the option for 1 or 2 guests therefore  I emailed the company directly to organise this trip to ensure all 4 guests are included which caused some issues in payment.  I was first told they didn’t have the facilities to pay by card and expected me to have carried RS21,000 in cash which I didn’t. Then the lady met me where we were having lunch and we agreed that I would pay online through their website.  As we were about to get on the quad bikes I was told to get connected on the wi-fi to pay but didn’t want to delay the group so I said I would pay at the end of the tour. I went to the office at the end to pay which had a card machine but failed to have any connection and having to connect on their wi-fi for payment.  If the website was clear on the lunch then i wouldn’t have had to deal with this ordeal. The guide was not at all informative about all the places we visited as his English was very limited and luckily I speak creole I had to get some details from him.   When we arrived at Rochester falls he handed us coconuts and pineapple which was refreshing but didn’t tell the guest we had to pay as we all thought it was part of the package.  We were charged RS 800 (~£20) for four coconuts and 2 small pineapples which is shocking! The guide only allowed the female drive the quad bikes for 5 mins out of the whole 5 hours on a bit of flat road.  My boyfriend and I had took it in turns but after a fews minutes of driving he stopped and made me swap even though I was keeping up with the group! I understand the terrain and route can be quite challenging but nothing that couldn’t be handled by both male and female. Considering the amount we paid the lunch was adequate but I have been on many tours in Mauritius and paid tenth of the cost to get very nice traditional food and not sandwiches. Hence I give this trip a 6 as the route was fantastic but there are a lot of improvements in the service required   ",6
19441,Very well organized ,10
41682,Friendly environment  Nice to see the history  Of course the bourbon was pretty good to. Lol,10
239546,The facility was beautiful.  The tastings were great.  Our guide couldn’t answer a few questions but otherwise was great.,8

41705,We stopped by late on Saturday and the tour was full for the day.  But i was able to purchase a bottle of Russell's reserve and have it signed by Jimmy which was cool.  I made  reservations on your web site for the first tour on Sunday and our guide was Bubba who was outstanding.  My group had been to 2 other distilleries on  Saturday and i was glad Wild Turkey was our last stop on Sunday as that tour was clearly the best.  And Wild Turkey 101 has been my preferred bourbon for years.  We all had a great time.    Thanks!,9
27310,,10
27254,Romel was a great guide - fun and personable.  Edwin was our driver and was also very good.  Of course the rum was great!  You should stick more “bar ware” in the gift shop.  I would love a nice set of glasses like you have on the bar for our home.,10

27207,"Our tour guide was Steven.  I can not say enough about the job that this employee did.  His mellow attitude made the experience all the more enjoyable.  Putting up with my 2 compadres isnt always easy, lol. He is a credit to Anchor Brewery. The tour was both informative and entertaining. Will definitely do ",10

44009,Nice tour.  Very interesting farm,10

27386,"Team Nepal Eco Adventure offers super efficiënt,very to the point & no no-nonsence support & advise , not Only throughout the entire trekking but also before & after of you wish. They know their business like no other,always putting safety  & Health of the group as priority no 1: they may go against Some wishes/plans/iDEAL of groupmembers if they  feel it could jeopardize the above. Apart from all the above the team has good spirit & excellent sence of humor. I'm already checking out their wide range of trekkings for a next challenge.",10
27393,"Everything was great, i would highly recommend the Company to friends. The only (small!) issue was the airport transfer - we had to wait for over an hour to be picked up from the airport and i had to wait for a while to be taken to the airport as well. But no biggie, the trek itself was fantastic! ",9
19573,"We had the time of our lives today. We caught lots of fish and the our hosts at JPH Charters were amazing. We are only here for 10 days and thinking about doing it all again. Can't recommend deep sea fishing enough. Really enjoyed it and can't stop talking about it. Thank you so much to our hosts, you know who you are! 😘😘😘😃😃😃😃",10
40427,Such a fun event.,10
19617,The tour was great! The history of the brewery is amazing and the beer was great!,10
40419,"This is by far the best stop on the Bourbon Tour. We loved the feeling as we entered the visitors center, so much wood. Love that. On the tour Bubba did a fantastic job of telling the group about Wild Turkey. The highlight for us was getting to spend a few minutes chatting with Jimmy. We even had him sign a bottle for us. I’m saving that for a special occasion. Thank you all for a great visit. James and Pam ",10
27379,The tour guide was super informative and friendly! Loved it,10
27373,"The tour was not as good as last time. We didn’t see the third floor, the summary of the business was less involved and the tasting felt rushed and wasn’t clear on what we were drinking. I preferred the event the last two times I have visited ",5
27423,The tour is very well planned and allows to see many sites that you could not visit in one day on your own. I also appreciated that lunch is optional and you are not forced to eat in a touristic restaurant as mostly happens with organized torus.,10
24875,The staff and owners were very friendly and excited to share their experiences. The whiskeys were fantastic and the atmosphere very enjoyable.,10
24034,Very friendly and knowledgeable staff/owners. Will be back!,10
24888,"The experience was fantastic! The staff was so friendly and knowledge. The tour was interesting and we were excited how thoughtful and responsible the entire distillery process is. We enjoyed a cocktail, taco and conversation after the tour. ",10
24688,Tour was great. Dennis gave great information and enjoyed what he was doing. Product was great also. Looking forward to doing the DYOB soon,10
27439,We understood we would be in an open jeep not a minibus with only 2 windows that opened not the best mode of transport for a safari.,4
27397,Great way to see the city. Perrine was very knowledgeable,10
25476,"The tour and tasting were a great experience!! Our tour guide Darrell was incredibly knowledgeable and passionate. The only critique I have is in regards to the tasting-- they could definitely be more generous when it comes to the tasting pour. I would say that we probably got less than 0.5 ounces on the tasting pours which felt a bit strange-- we were definitely expecting closer to 1 ounce tasting pours. Having said that, the whiskey is great, especially for someone who is not a big fan of bourbon. Because they are brand new they will not have any aged whiskey for several years, but what they've got going on right now is still impressive. The ancho spiced whiskey is by far my favorite and their cocktails were great. Moreover, the food pop-up outside (Puli-Ra) is incredible!! Definitely a spot worth hitting up. ",8
27449,The place is a great place for thoes who love a great time with friends and family. The drinks are great and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  The live music is nice and location is easy to get to. Can't wait to go back.,10

27428,"Great tour, great beer! ",10
59019,No plan whatsoever for rain.  Zero opportunity to sample,0
124084,The vast majority of the tour -- except visiting the cemetary -- was standing by an empty breeding stall listening to a lengthy explanation of breeding and seeing stallions in their stalls.  I would have like to see some of the property and mares with their foals. I stayed an extra night in KY to visit the farm and was disappointed.,5
19574,"Very clean, easy of booking online, great prices. ",10
27484,Great tour and great guides,9
39219,Our tour guide Jon was personable articulate and fun.  The tour was interesting espcially if you really like the beer and you are local and know the history.  Tasting all the beers afterward was icing on the cake!  We also bought some of the beer we tasted...Coffee Porter!,10
59020,From the tour to the tasting and the new visitors center it was a wonderful 2 hours of relaxing. ,10
42160,Excellent experience. Tour guides were great and accomodating.,10
42732,My dad loved his experience at beer school and totally enjoyed “the teacher” and  commented that the class was informational! ,10
19680,"The crew was lovely.  The boat was nice.  The day had just enough activities to keep us entertained.  We were a group of eight and were very loud and teased the crew a lot but they took it all in stride and were just wonderful.  We enjoyed the music and the food, (although I suspect our drinks were non-alcoholic) ---however, it didn't take one thing away from the experience. Best day spent out of our trip.",10
41101,The tour was very informative and the fact that you are the only whiskey distillers in Austin is very cool as well!,10
11893,Great service!,10
11322,Freindly and safe drivers who were always on time.  Clean and safe vehicles and interesting conversation; I learned a brief history of your country that made my visit more meaningful.

40494,The food was amazing and the hosts were very knowledgeable on beer and the specific brands.,10
40463,That was so fun!!!  We are so lucky we work for a company that treats us to these awesome experiences.  Many thanks!,10
39297,Had a wonderful time touring the distillery on my trip from Virginia to Colorado.  I learned many new interesting things and Bubba was an outstanding and funny tour guide.  Also enjoyed that there was only 3 people in the tour and not overly crowded.  Thank you for a wonderful experience!,10
40418,"It was a lovely presentation. We enjoyed it and learned a lot about the making process.  I really enjoyed being able to take something home from the last one we had gone to earlier that day.  Kind of justifies the $22.  Overall, my boyfriend and I really enjoyed the tour and our tour guide was amazing.  ",9

19566,Great history at this place,10
27487,Look forward to visiting again when you have opened your premium experience - having been on a number of whisky tours I hope your new experience works well,10
19575,"Guide was friendly and efficient..   MIndo Cloud Forest Zip Lining experience was beautiful, well organized and amazing.  Liked trip to Center of the Earth and guide there.  Chocolate stop was disappointing in that we thought we were going to have a chocolate ""tour"".  Perhaps we misunderstood.   Otherwise great day!",10
41996,Brought a group of friends here to celebrate ones 30th birthday and we had such a great time! All the beers we sampled were excellent! Would love to bring my husband next time!,10

19682,,9
39222,It was just the right amount of Information and the right amount of Beer. We‘ve had a fun evening! ,10
19733,"Braden was a blast!  He is funny and knowledgeable. We had a good time I  the tour and trying all the beers. The only critique I have is allowing more time for the tasting. We found that our bellies experienced a bit of discomfort as we were throwing back the beers quite quickly in order to get to taste them all. Also, Texas might be a market saturated in Mexican lagers, but I so wish y'all sold the Los Gigantes down there!  Other than that, we had an amazing time! ",10
19679,"Garvan was knowledgeable, enthusiastic, dynamic, humorous and extremely professional. He was a pleasure to spend 5 hours with.",10
128613,"Clean, fun, and overall high quality!",10
141768,"Everyone, from Perry at the gate, to John on the tour, were full of knowledge. Beautiful history. ",10
19739,We felt a little conned because  it wasn't where Famous Grouse is made but we found the tour interesting and informative. I would recommend putting a less scented soap in the toilets as you do not want a strong scent on your hands when tasting the whisky. ,7
39299,"Everything about it was great, the information was given in a fun way, the samples and rum punch were lovely & the buffet food was excellent. Would recommend to everyone.",10
41994,The tour guide seemed rushed. Allowing more time with the horses would have been nice.  ,7

27545,Our tour guide was fun and friendly. Enjoyed our little journey and taste testings.,10
19715,Personal and professional!,10
3102,"It was hyped up as a great beer tour but really it didn't have much to it at all. I am glad it only cost 5$.  Then, we drank four beers that were part of the craft beer alliance! I went to redhook to drink redhook and nothing else.  I'll still drink some longhammer but I'll be damn sure not to recommend the beer tour at all.  ",1
3087,"The facility is beautiful.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Ashley, who gave us the tour, was fabulous! We were also impressed with the process at the facility, how Redhook gets involved with the community, and how much your recycle and reuse. Love it!",10
3470,Informative. Guide very knowledgeable. Samples were great!,10
4359,great info and atmosphere,10

124063,"The tour guide did a great job, he was very well versed.   We had a great time and are looking forward to touring the distillery on our next visit.",10
4736,To be honest I felt like tour was rushed and we really didn't go into the berwery very much. I have done dozens of berwery tours all over NE and most of them take you into each room of the brewing process. The other thing that didn't understand was why we started in canning/bottling area first then went backwards. Never seen that before most of the time it goes with the process of making beer. I did really like that you could see the QA area and what not. I just felt like the girl doing the tour was more into the samples then anything. Also like the fact you get a glass at the end of the tour. ,6
5024,"The dining room was packed, and the waitress was still very professional and welcoming. The tour guide was informative and relaxed, letting our six-year-old explore and breaking down the beer making process into understandable terms. We enjoyed our impromptu visit very much!",8
7010,"While we did enjoy our time, other tours we have been on we're more beer forward information wise. This tour was Red Hook forward. I wanted to know more about the beer making choices, ingredients, etc.  again, enjoyable, friendly, clean, etc. but not informative enough for more ""seasoned"" beer nerds. ",6
7881,The tour wasn't super exciting. The tasting was my favorite. The food was really yummy. ,8
19708,Great tour! Fun guide! Amazing beer! A+++,10
8580,We were lucky that there were only two on the tour.  Guide was very knowledgeable and informative.  Great time.  Beer was amazing as well ,10
8530,Cool tour and informative. Good beer and decent food for the price. Will go again. ,10
39355,"We were picked up at our hotel right on time and our guide and our driver started pointing out fascinating birds before we even reached Manuel Antonio Park. Our guide, Jason, was fantastic and really made the trip amazing. He was very personable, knowledgeable and funny. With his expert eyes, he spotted and pointed out many unique birds and animals hidden in the jungle. We saw several sloths, monkeys, iguanas, lizards, parrots, birds, frogs, plants, insects and the largest rodents in Costa Rica. Jason was able to share interesting facts about all the animals and plants we saw, plus personal information about the people of Costa Rica. We highly recommend taking a tour with Jason!",10
27597,"We had a really great tour on Saturday 3:30pm. The guide took good care of us and explained everything really well, what we thought was great as it was the last tour of the day and she was still really enthusiastic and took her time for us. It was a shame we could not visit one of the warehouses but apart from that it was a great tour and would totally recommend it.",8
41690,My wife and I had a great time seeing everything. Learning how the beers we love so much are made. Thank you for having tours.,10
27715,"The tour guide is a big sunshine (Leandro, I think was his name :s). The weather wasnit that great but he made it. Better for us. But I was disapointed, that we left Pao do Azucar before sunset. I saw it before and it is amazing to see the lights between the hills.",8
27561,The trek was well lead and well organised. Ram the group lead and DB the assistant guide were brilliant and assisted in every way they could! Communication in the lead up to the trek was very good also. Thank you,10
961,This was a great couple of hours spent with a passionate tour guide who was interesting until the end. We could see the full workings of this family-run distillery and they are really geared up for small groups with a great little shop at the end but the highlight for me was the tasting. ,10
27727,The boss was very flexible. I could change my trek dates and flight within 10 minutes.,9
27711,Our 3rd tour with Celia - to Covent Garden this time.  As interesting and enjoyable as the first two.  We thought we knew this area well but Celia showed us great new places and new tastes.  Would thoroughly recommend Celia's tours.    Jim and Jennifer Scott,10
59025,Great tour by Sean!,10
39417,I suppose I was the most disappointed that we were not able to see the Clydesdales. That was really the only reason I booked the tour.,1
39471,The tour guides were very knowledgeable and friendly. The facility was beautiful and the horses magnificent. And of course the “refreshments” were great.,10
27683,"Interactive center, however the limited amount of tours to see the factory and limited areas that could actually be visited made it a short trip and few souvenir options. ",8
27590,I dont love beer but it was a great tour and a lot of fun.. ,5
40395,Everything about our rickshaw ride was great! It was such a memorable experience and a great way to see Arashiyama. From booking to the actual ride it was easy and enjoyable. I received lots of help from Larissa and had lots of laughs with Kiyo and Kose. Nothing was ever a problem for their team. We were even 30 minutes late to our booking but were met with smiles and great manners! We ended our ride in a great spirit and with amazing photos! Thank you again!!,10

27801,"It was good experience. The only thing I would change is about the local buses.  You might want to give options to your clients.  For example, that there is a flight out to Kathmandu from Pokhara that clients can take for 100 USD instead of the local bus.    ",9
27794,All inclusive FUN... 😎😎😎😎😎,10
25142,"Everything was great! We happened to be the only folks touring so it was very nice of the tour guide to give us a private tour. I wish I could remember his name because he was super friendly.

27804,"To be honest it felt a lot like a commercial for Mount Gay rum. I would have loved to hear more about the history and origins of the rum, for example, how methods of sugar cane cultivation have changed or how distillation techniques have evolved. Sure, modern rum is aged in old American whiskey barrels, but what kind of barrels were used to age Mount Gay rum hundreds of years ago? Overall, the tour is okay, but I would much more strongly recommend the St Nicholas Abbey tour, because it did incorporate more historical information and was not so self promotional.",3
27823,"I was a little disappointed that the distillery tour didn’t actually include a tour of the distillery. The 7 minute film we watched was, essentially, a repeat of everything D told us. The rum tasting, however, was very interesting. ",9

27827,Tour guide was enthusiastic and knowledgeable,10
39398,"With just a little guidance for ""what to look for inside"" I like the fact that the museum is self-guided.  Visitors can look at what they like, spend time with what interests them and see the whole of Honda history.  Well thought out visually and experientially.",10

The minivan was uncomfortable, very worn on the inside.  The folding walker was placed in front of the other passengers which was an unfortunate thing for them.  Very difficult for me to get in the van, a step would have been helpful.  The beach was fine.  The tour seemed like a real estate tour.  Little history was given.  The driver zipped through the entire tour.  ",5

Romal helped me plan and arrange transport and, when he realised that I could not use the stairs up to the viewing room (film part of the tour) , he gave us a personal tasting of all 5 Mount Gay rums on the terrace. The staff at lunch brought food to our table (even though it was a help yourself buffet).

28265,"Too much lecturing at the beginning.  If the guide is going to do that much talking, there should be more visuals.  Or maybe flip the tour- see the operation first, then talk about Anchor history while tasting.",8
28229,"Because your operation is more legitimate than the Rebecca Creek shill, more similar to my all time favorite Garrison Brother's. Ensuring people understand barrels shipped offsite were barreled on site, and do not leave Texas is important. ",10

She looked after everyone without being intrusive; on the walk itself we simply descended at our own pace, which was ideal.

I know that nobody can change the weather, but i don‘t pay over 2000 Rupies to be wet all day because of the rain and be freezing. I think they should have cancelled the cruise and do it on another day or give back the money. ",3

123177,"The facility was beautiful, the food and drinks were very good, and the price was right. The only reason I didn’t give a 10 was I thought it was tacky to change the drink price 1/2 way through the event, and  there was a very obnoxious, drunk man that kept harassing all the tables. I brought it to the attention of a young man at the front door, but I don’t know if anything was done. A couple hours later, as we were leaving, the drunk man tripped and spilled his drink down my pants  and others who were nearby. We still had a great time, and will be back.  ",9

43473,It was incredible to see American Pharoah and we got lots of time with him. Which was awesome. I know it's super difficult but if the tour was before the feeding it would improve it greatly because many of the horses were facing the back  of the stalls making it difficult to see. More focus on the other great stallions would be great too. But the farm is the prettiest of all the farms and you have the best list of stallions,7

40475,Great set up great beer great people.  Would highly recommend doing something similar to be open to the public.  Having a craft beer weekend using the assets that we had on display as well as bringing in people from the breweries I think would be a huge success and get people in St. Louis really excited about our craft beer portfolio.,10

28515,Leaders of both the Heritage Center and auto plant tour were very personable and informative. It was amazing to see the work that goes into an automobile from start to finish and also the quality control standards implemented. Now we know exactly why we have driven Honda cars since 1983.,10

40491,Awesome time!,10
20113,"Patrick Brown never returns voicemails. Plus I called and emailed yesterday with plenty of notice, asking if we could come earlier for a non-private tour. No reply to my emails or yet another voicemail left on Patrick's voicemail. ",0
20185,Beer was good. Tour was interesting. ,8

28675,This is a must when in Rio! We had so much fun! Samba is such a beautiful dance style and Patrick goes out of his way to make the class super fun and interesting. He not only dances beautifully but his teaching techniques are perfect and easy to understand. We were a group of three adults and two kids and we all loved it! Muito OBRIGADO!!!!!,10

28728,Organisation et suivi sur place très réactif ,10
28680,"The Rafting tour was a lot of fun with a great instructor. The waterfalls we went to were beautiful and our driver was great, very friendly and knowledgeable and took us to a lot of places we wouldn’t have otherwise gone. The only thing was we wish we could have gone to the casa del Arbol in the morning because there were a lot of people there when we went which made it less enjoyable and the sun was in a position that made all of our photos very dark. But that was a very minor issue. We loved our day in Banos and wish we could have stayed longer.",9
56947,"The cocktail making was great fun, and very informative. The tour was entertaining - though I’d prefer the video narrator to be Barbadian (or English!) rather than American.  You should find some way of allowing customers to taste the 1703 - I suggested you give a sip to the cocktail making winners, I know it’s expensive, but since you rate it as special, it would make it memorable!",9
286889,Very interesting tour and different view from others. Tasting was nicely setup and the guide we had was great. ,9
40496,An immersion experience like this is essential to raising morale here at the Brewery and it exposes those that are not out in the field to all of the brands that we represent!,10
28634,"Andrew definitely spoke too fast during the tour as if he was in a hurry. The script used during the tour seems to assume we are in the same business as you are and familiar with the distillation process and terminology--which we are not. That's one reason we are there. YOU are the experts.-Not us. It wasn't crafted for a general audience. The tasting seemed hurried as well. I also asked a couple of questions that I think Andrew should have offered to confirm the answer with management instead saying the first thing that popped into his head. It didn't sound accurate. It would have been just fine to hear ""let me ask Zack"" or something.  I tasted some excellent whisky at Balcones and I know you are proud of your product. I'm willing to try the tour experience again. Perhaps under different circumstances.  Thanks for reading.  Tom ",4
20197,I enjoyed the tour but a bit much for 50 bucks for two,8

20305,"Hi there,  I'd love an email to discuss further- my tour on Saturday at 3:30pm was perhaps the first time I've had a brewery tour and actually come away liking the brand less! Was excited to have family visiting and take them on a visit to my favourite brewery for what has always been a really good experience. Our tour guide was a bad reflection of the company- forgetting parts of the history, getting everyone to shout out the barvarian purity law in german (super awkward given Charlottesville and everything else going on right now) and just generally acting less like a brand rep and a bit more like frat dude who had a beer as we walked around and had probably had a few earlier. I don't want to see anyone get fired, but it may be worth you having him take you on a tour and see how he fares compared to what you'd like the experience to be. I've had friends work both front of house and in bottling at the brewery, and was sad to see Steamwhistle repped in such a well, very lame way, when its always been my favourite beer. Cheers, michaeljohnvickers@gmail.com",0
28788,Because the tour guider was to extensive in its explanations. The explanations of all the pieces of history should be not that detailed but more briefed,6
28828,The tour was very informative and enjoyable. Would recommend to any visitors in Scotland.  Would be happy if tour visitors are offered discounts for all ranges of whiskey instead of just the three expensive ones. ,8
42175,Jon and Jared were fantastic. Loved how the tour was product focused - we truly got to taste the variety of beers from Anchor. Loved all the historic memorabilia around the room. ,9

But the breakfast was not so good - old bread and old Croissants...While the crew is coming in the morning with fresh beverages and food for the next tourist group, it would be possible to bring some fresh bread and croissants.  Also the bathroom smells not fresh. Finally it was a good experience, but in our opinion the breakfast and the cleaniness of the bathroom could be better for this price.",6

28957,"Everything was perfect in the tour! The guide was really good and the beers and everything was interesting. The only reason I didn't gave you 10 is the past place, the food wasn't the best there and it's a shame because everyone was really hungry.. ",9

Ram is a very experienced and steady person who places group safety and wellbeing first. He is also a wealth of knowledge and answered any questions asked. The porters and assistant guide were also excellent, extremely professional and very nice to trek with. I felt very safe and very well cared for on the trek. The only query I have is about day 14 of the trek, we decided to get a jeep at Hile and I think this would be a better way to plan as it is a long day.  I want to thank you for a wonderful experience that I will remember for The rest of my life.",10

2853,Not everyone I know likes tours. In addition I would have liked to see a tour with more solo travellers like myself since it would be a good way to meet others. I think some way to have more solo travellers on each tour would be beneficial.   ,8

40429,I think the Love Beer Street Festival was an extraordinary way to employee exposed to craft brands and interact with those brewing and supporting those brands. Also was just a great show of employee appreciation for all the hard work for all the company is involved with and accomplishing. Would be wonderful if this was an annual event as we continue to build brands and expand into new beer adjacent categories.,9
40553,"It was a top notch event with a lot of activity and opportunities to enjoy tastings, pairings, and delicious food.  Lines were not horrible, it was spread out enough so that you didn't feel cramped, and combining all of that with socializing among colleagues was a lot of fun.",10

1986,"It was very very interesting and the guide women knew so much about vienna. I enjoyed it a lot. The point why I don't give 10 points is, that 2,5 hours is a very long time (in my opinion maybe too long) and our guide talked so much that our tour lasted 3 hours. And that was too long.",9
20402,"It is an active trip, the guide takes you to the mountains, you discover beautiful unique places and caves, you swim in a cave with unique clear and healthy water, we eat a tapas dinner in a local restaurant (very good), the Guide also gives you a lot of explanation and his stories are pretty fun.

2027,It was a big tour 32 people which I felt distracted and limited interactions. If I'd know it was to be 32 I likely won't not have attended but used the morning to wander around myself. My friend had gone earlier in the week and the guide sounded really interesting and enjoyable that's why I signed up. Mine covered most big structures  which was good but nothing really intimate regarding Vienna. ,8

2313,"Or guide Wolfgang was funny and informative. Although I was a bit hesitating in the beginning because of his age in comparison to other Free-Tour guides, which he explained right in the beginning, well done! Also it was nice that he was a local guy, could tell things from his life in Vienna and could give nice recommendations :-).",10
20407,Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and spoke confidently about how the whisky is produced.  It was very interesting to see how everything works and to learn more about whisky.  The place is beautifully maintained.  The only thing that could be improved on is that we didn't see a link on the website for directions to find the Famous Grouse.   ,10

42484,"Well organized, very informative and excellent tour guide!",10
59067,Our tour guide was great very enthusiastic.  Loved the information given to us about wild turkey. Loved the taste testing. The only thing I’d change is being able to take home a tasting glass like four roses does.  ,10

39455,"My husband,  son and I had an amazing experience touring the Budweiser grounds. Our tour guide was very informative, professional and fun. Thank you all very much!",10
29306,My only suggestion for improvement would be for guest to have the option to take a glass home. I have no problem paying the full price and not taking the glass. However as an international visitor getting the glass home was not something I could do and the glasses became a hassle. ,7
2230,The tour was complete and very interesting. It is a very good way to know the most important sightseeings. The guide was proffessional and kind.,10

39456,Jon was really knowledgeable and friendly. The tour was a great pace and trying all the beer was a blast. I would have liked to hear from the workers there what they were doing at the moment/what kind of beer they were making and maybe a demonstration but the existing tour was great.

124071,"We were delayed at our previous stop and missed the actual start time for our planned 11am tour, but the receptionist invited us to at least observe the surgery in progress and look at the photo galleries in the hallways, which we were so happy to do.  While we were looking, a lovely woman, Deborah Kaufman, approached and offered to give us a quick tour.  We were so grateful—I am a nurse and my husband is a surgeon, so this visit held extra special meaning for us.  Not only was Deborah so very gracious to take us around and explain the various areas and services, but even introduced us to other employees who further answered questions and explained processes.  Rood and Riddle rivals any human healthcare institution we’ve  experienced, really a remarkable place. Thank you!!",10

2552,"Magdalena had a lot of information about the city and very interesting stories she told us. She made the tour very interesting. Although she was not Spanish, her Spanish was really good. She could make it more dynamic, but I guess that is her style.",6
2503,It was gret,10
20416,"Tour was arranged pretty well overal. The free day could have been planned in by you aswell, it felt a bit weird that suddenly you have a day off. (We knew up front ofcourse.)  Different contacts during the preparations and especially during the trip we saw different people as guides every event which prevented any kind of bonding, The food was average at most.",7
43096,"Everything was great. However, in The Malt room, I could barely hear what Tom was saying. Is there a way to improve this? Thanks.",10
29469,"Thought these tours were great, and very fun and informative. My tour guides V and Arias did such a fantastic job. I will definitely recommended to anyone I know that is traveling to Prague!",10
20429,Very interesting,9
29454,"Called ahead to see if we could come early and have lunch but when we arrived the chef wasn't there so they could only offer us appetizers. No much of a tour more of a bar, tasting and gift shop.",6
2918,"We were very privileged to have Eva as our guide. The tour itself was so fascinating - we could have stayed all day - we even invited Eva out for a drink afterwards. The tour itself was accomplished - she brought so much meaning to the city's wonderful treasures. Her enthusiasm was contagious and when a guide brings so much care and attention to detail - with film, photos and expert recommendation too - you cannot fail to have a memorable experience. If Eva is reading this - that drink offer still stands. We were so glad to have met you. Very best wishes,  Gill and Marilyn from the UK.   ",10

2917,Iva was a fantastic tour guide!! Very knowledgeable and friendly with a great sense of humor. ,10
20501,"Public bus seems also a good option. Breakfast was a rip off, expensive and rather bad.  Why not include all costs ( ferry, entrance etc) in advertised price ? ",7
29430,Love your product. However was not happy with the tasting room experience. Our person poured tasting and walked away never once explaining what she had just poured. I even commented to her that I was observing person next to us talking about everything thing he was pouring. She essentially shrugged and said just push your glass forward when done tasting and I’ll rinse and move on to next pours,10

20538,"Professional, courteous, friendly, on-time and safe drivers!",10
20514,"Arrived 2 hours before boat departure, which meant he were on a crowded boat for a such a long time for no reason. Secondly, the suspension of the mini bus was terrible, which meant that our backs felt every road pothole. It would have been safer and more relaxed if we got a taxi to Kissamos ourselves.",0
29484,Fun experience. Staff are super friendly and informative.  Very nice atmosphere.  Product . . . Great stuff.  Tour was interesting but a little too long. ,10

20596,"The tour was really interesting, James was extremely informative, he was very easy to listen to, everyone could hear him, (he was a really good speaker) and he was able to tell us so much information that it really made the walk around Prague come to life. My partner and I were only in Prague for a couple of days but going on the Tour with James means that we both really now want to return. We will be sharing this with work colleagues. ",10

39470,we did not have time to tour but the tasting lady was very instructive and presented your good product very well,8
20563,I had been thinking about taking the tour for a long time. I'm not only an Anchor Steam consumer but also somehow live in the neighborhood (Dogpatch.) We took the tour as a work team activity and we all enjoyed it a lot. Too bad we were not able to visit the bottling/packaging area but we understand the limitations due to safety.  I can't wait for the Coffee beer to be out in the market as well as the holiday's brew.,10
20582,Mike was a really good guide! Very informative :),10
20621,The facility was set up very well. we enjoyed looking at all the older versions of the Honda vehicles.   The hours that you are available for associates to come for a visit is very limited. A first shift worker cannot visit unless taking a day of vacation.  I really don't think it should be tooo much to ask to have it available for the people who do the real work for the Honda Company,7
20634,Nice and Clean....the hostage lade was really nice....the history is amazing from the start to this days. ,10

29666,Rumal was witty and well informed about the history of the rum as well as general island history. He really helped us understand how to properly taste a rum and gave us words to describe what we were tasting. ,10
29744,Love your lager and summer ale but didn’t get enough on tour,6
4566,"The tour didn't fully match the description of things we would do and see. However, our guide Christina was very informative and amusing and made for a pleasant walk around the beautiful city of Vienna. I had forgotten to get a schedule of the operas from her and I saw her with a tour group later that day. She remembered my parents and I and was more than willing to help us out by giving us her last one from her bag!",8
4642,"In general, it was fine. However, the guide lacked in generating interest and enthusiasm from the tourists as they were accompanying her. It could have been more information with some level of liveliness and fun!! Plus, also talk more about history and culture as we walk along.",5

20620,"The guide was not good enough, in our opinion",6
29737,The guide was great. I did walking toyr also with him. I booked englisg tour with this guide on wednesday be ause he said will not be bilingual tour. Ended up being spanish also for 2 ladies. I did kutna hora tour also very good guide. Happy to recommend,10
29710,Greatee,10
20681,Everything was well organized; your answers by e-mail were always quick and accurated and also in Greece we had no problems to contact you every time we needed.,10
20689,Because the day was foggy and bad weather - you could not see anything on the glacier. The tour guide should have cancelled the tour. Very sad. ,2
40531,I was impressed with the choice of food trucks,10
40533,"Great environment, great food",10

The tours are informative and fun, and the staff go out of their way to ensure that everyone has a great time - generous servings of rum help too! We'd happily recommend a trip to Mount Gay to any Barbados visitor. Andy & Sharon Moore, Derbyshire, England. (Cocktail Workshop, 29 Nov 2017) ",10
29698,"The tour was enlightening, and the specifics behind the various batches/labels helped me identify my flavor preferences. Additionally, the crucial role that Mt. Gay plays in Barbados society makes it a brand for which support means more than just good rum.",9
3304,"the guide (Barbara, I joined the German tour) had many interesting stories to tell, we walked nearly 3 hours and even after these 3 hours she was still willing to show us things on our way to the metro. She had an answer to every question and obviously showed, she loved what she was doing (showing us the nice spots of Vienna)",10
5560,"La guía española era pésima. De la vieja escuela. No aportaba nada al tour que no se pueda leer en una guía de Viena. La esencia del freetour es el turismo experiencial. Acercarse al turista y engancharle en la historia de la ciudad y su ambiente. Con ella solo conseguimos aburrirnos y acabar saturados de fechas y datos históricos sin obtener una perspectiva especial de Viena. Reitero, era como leer una simple guía o folleto de Viena. Nada especial.",0

5766,"The tour was very informative, and the guide (Iva) made very good use of visual aids and video on her iPod. She was engaging and entertaining, and came across as really enjoying sharing her knowledge with the tour party.  I also like the idea of paying the tour guide in proportion to the value that you get out of the tour. This was illustrated by a couple of members of our party paying Iva even though they had to leave before the end. I took a similar tour in Prague with the same results.",10
3556,"The tour was the perfect length, the guide (Iva) showed passion and energy to tell the stories of the city. ",9
20679,"Walking through Dublin with Cathal felt like being shown around by an old friend. Funny, knowledgeable and good humoured. I would recommend this tour to anyone visiting this great city. Stories, songs and historical knowledge. Fabulous. ",10
3577,"I would like to go faster to see more places. Vienna is a very big city and by myself I couldn't go very fast and to understand what I see. But in the end I saw more by walking without the tour. I would like to be more fun, more pleasure, more joy, :)  Hope the next tourist will be more satisfied. :)",3

She talked about things that weren't relevant at all. And I believe she dismissed telling us other important things, history, and only mentioned the buildings. I feel like I wasted my time and leave Vienna without knowing the important things.",4
3685,Our guide Lee was excellent. Enjoyed the    historical background. Answered our questions and gave us a very good restaurant recommendation ,10

They were on time, professional, knowledgable, excited about their jobs, great at communicating and sharing with us the wonders of Costa Rican ecosystems. They were stunningly adept at spotting so many wonderful creatures we would not have seen without them.  Excellent tours! I also want to mention our accommodating Jade Tours driver Christian who went out of his way to help us with special requests. Great company!  Jade Tours is doing an exceptional job of connecting visitors with a community of excellent local people who are supporting the environment via ecotourism, and helping this community sustain itself, while bringing terrific experiences to visitors.

4496,Very informed guide,10
3893,"No Spanish tour. The group was far to big, at some moments would not even hear the voice of the guide. The ""technical stop"" should be a little longer it was less than 10 mins, i wanted to buy a bottle of water but couldn't do both .. either it was the water or bathroom.... Finally the speed of the tour was too fast, and we passed through important places that were not mentioned by the guide (the clock for instance)",3

21009,Jarred was a great tour guide. Thank you!!,10
20990,"Well, first and foremost, your beer is terrific. Our tour guide, Jarred, was great--just enough ""beer humor"" and lots of knowledge. Hot day/cold beer: who could ask for anything more?",10

4436,Lively informative guide Eva.,9
4137,Clear and freindly and very profetionnel. With iva ,9
21205,"It was a nice enough visit. It felt more like a story telling, most of which could probably be found online, than an actual tour of the brewery. And the beers we tasted are 90% available in the stores, nothing in-house/experimental. Not really worth the money. Probably good for a tourist or beer novice, but I was disappointed as I am neither.",5

21239,"Organized, interesting, reasonably priced",10
21139,"I love the product but I was very disappointed by the tour. The tour was rushed and was not close to an hour, more like 30 minutes.  The tour guide was winging it without much info. Definitely not worth the $100+ spent. If I do go back I will just be doing the tasting. ",5

21106,"Friendly, knowledgeable, thorough tour. Generous beer tasting. Much better selection of beer than I thought. Would recommend the beer and the tour!",10
21177,Respect that you are keeping all of the old world brewing  techniques alive. Also excited to learn how simple your recipes are. I would have never guessed that a flavorful brew such ad Liberty Ale was actually a SMASH recipe. ,9

21425,Patrick was an excellent guide ,10
21342,"Some of the guides were amazing, but once they were gone, out with another group, etc. it was impossible to feel safe and taken care of.  Our bus tickets were by no means well taken care of. I was told I would get mine three days before my travel date, and I didn't. Plus, our return bus tickets were a scramble to get, and the return bus was awful compared to Movil (we got this bus because Movil was booked up, due to Tambopata not booking them in advance).  As mentioned before, aside from one or two guides, the rest of the staff were very unfamiliar with helping us guests be organized and figure out our itineraries. Although the adventures were spectacular (Carlos who took us to the late gets a rating of 15/10, he was AMAZING) going with a different company might have saved us a lot of stress.",4

Never said to go find the bus so I thought there was a second stop . I did return just in time and was taken to the bus just in time.  As for the tour it was great. Sorry this happened  as I knew I would be taking a bus, but at your stand that this was not communicated . All worked out in the end.   ",4

21487,This was a nice tour whit Jarred as our guide. He was a good speaker and the person on the right place. Nice and interesting history and lots of nice beer. We enjoyd this a lot. ,10
21461,It was really interesting to see the old school methods Anchor Brewing uses and to learn about the history. There was a heat wave the weekend we went so the only thing that could've improved our experience was AC or at least a few fans in the tasting room.,10
21518,"The bartender was the best, friendly with great knowledge of craft beers. The food was great and it was right across the street from our concert.",10
21479,The tour guide was a bit abrasive.,6

The tour guide Iva was very friendly and had a good knowledge of the historic significance of Vienna.   This is a great starting point for someone who is new to the city.  The reason I chose 9 is because I felt she was advertising for a few places too much. It is not a bad thing, just concerns me.",9
21572,Such a fantastic experience.  Thank you again Andreas for making our vacation special ,10
21570,We took the free tour from Vaclav and Castle and Terezin tour from Rafa. Tours and the informations were amazing. Especially Rafa is amazingly energetic.,10
5200,No se escuchaba lo que contaba la guia (se lo dijimos varias veces y no hizo nada por arreglarlo). Muchos datos sueltos y faltos de enlazar. Grupo demasiado grande (mas de 30 personas) Poco entusiasmo de la guia. Nos contesto las dudas por encima y se fue enseguida al terminar el tour. ,1
21595,tour was AMAZING definitely worth the money ,10
40559,It was so nice to see happy faces and everyone enjoying themselves. Their was such a good selection of food and drinks to choose from. I really felt appreciated. ,10

21594,It was a Great experience I worked for Honda of America for almost 17 Years and it is great to see them give back something like this so the community and others can see what they represent it is really something to see and makes me proud to have worked there one thing I always preached to my people is be proud of what you do,10
21628,it was amazing!   Loved every minute of it!,10
4464,"My guide was very knowledgeable and I enjoyed the tour through the city. I usually do walking tours in new cities to acclimate and get my bearings. This was the first city tour I've done in which I ended up completely lost at the end. Maybe that's a function of Vienna? Either way, I'd suggest marking the route on the free maps handed out so it's clear to folks how they get back to the start. ",8
5138,Porque la guia hablaba muy flojo no se oia nada y no ponia ningun interes en que escucharamos lo que explicaba. Hemos echo muchos free tours pero ninguno tan nefasto como esto. No lo recomendaria a nadie ,0
21578,Garvin brings an energetic passion that is like no other tour I have been on. ,10
4636,Great guide,10

124108,Put what your doing down. Go do this thing. Thank me later.,10
21649,Bartek is a great guy! He is exceptionally knowledgeable yet very interesting during the walking tour. He gave some Polish and architectural lessons and is creative in teaching us how to remember the details by using day to day matters. He links everything nicely. ,10
6273,"Me and my husband had an incredible experience during the tour. Lada was an amazing guide. He offered us much more information than we expected and now, we believe we are able to say that we know Vienna a little more, the history of the buildings and also the empire. I totally recomend the tour. ",10
21677,It was fun,10
40561,"I wasn't really sure how to answer this survey question.  The experience yesterday was really great, but for employees only.  Not sure how I can recommend something like that to others, when that kind of experience to my knowledge is not available to them.",7
21625,"Tour was informative, but more could be done to emphasize the history of the brewery.  For example, there were two photos of the founders and one photo of the original building.  Add more pictures and paint a more anecdotal picture of the business.  Tour was not interactive or 'fun', and it would have benefitted from something more novel (not sure what...).  The operations weren't nearly as sophisticated as I imagined (e.g., I was surprised to see QA employees vs a robot camera) - I'd love to hear more about what each person does and hear their story.",8
21616,"The tour was informative and lighthearted, the beer was delicious, and the tour guide (Jarred) was a ton of fun. Looking forward to visiting again!",10
21652,our whole family enjoyed our visit very much. everything was very nice.,10

6093,it was ok. good value but long. good overview of history!!,6
3941,My tour guide Vaclav was an excellent guide. He was very knowledgeable and humorous. I unfortunately got separated from the group at some point and wasn't able to find my group again but I still managed to look at all of the left over attractions. Is it possible to get the group photo that one of the other tour guides took of my group before we started the tour in front of Myslbek Mall?,10
40564,Great atmosphere and experience all together!,10
131573,I personally would have liked to have a bit more of instruction maybe more in written form with pictures,6
7904,"Too much commercialism and selling of other tours. Did the walking tour because I wanted to know Prague history, what the monuments were and to become orientated. The tour started well with some good infirmation but it was given at a rather rapid pace. Then 20 mins was spent on language lessons and explaining other tours I could buy, then we went directly to stop for a coffee where there were representatives who could take cash or card for these tours. Overkill and too strong a sales pitch, taking up valuable time on a tour instead of taking the time to properly explain statues and buildings. I had aleady done a walking tour of prague with another company, (a friend arrived in the city later and wanted my company) and though your guide seemed more knowledgeable, the restrictions and demands you put upon him let the tour down. Preferred your guide person but unfortunately the other company's tour had no sales agenda and therefore I would recommend them and not you. It actually put me off the other tours because why pay to go to a sales pitch",4
9394,"The most valuable aspect of the tour was the historical and cultural aspect of Prague described by our guide Vaclav.  It was just detailed enough, without being too long. He was careful to keep our group together, gave us enough time to take pictures, and asked us if we preferred sunshine or shade. His English proficiency is high, and he has a good sense of humor!  Thanks for making our one day trip to Prague a memorable one.",10
5084,"The tour was great, lot of useful information and the guide Iva, was amazing, she is very good at this! Keep being awesome Iva! 😁",10
5182,"No se escuchaba nada, le dijeron que si podía hablar más alto y dijo que no, creo que es el séptimo tour que hacemos y nunca nos hemos ido a mitad de uno, pero no merecía la pena quedarse en este. La historia no la puedo valorar porque realmente no escuche nada. Además le hice un pregunta andando a la guía y fue bastante borde no se si es por su manera de hablar o porque no sabía la respuesta, ya que fue cortante y tampoco me la resolvió ",2
4668,"Great tour guide (Christiana),  grwat understanding of the city. ",10
21689,"Although I was happy that a lot of the time was devoted to sampling beer at the end, the tour around the facilities seemed too short for me.  I felt there could have been more time spent going through the brewing process and different areas and not just talking around the tasting room.",8

4710,"The tour was interesting, well organized, and relatively entertaining.  The guide was knowledgeable, spoke clearly and I really like it that he did a summary at the end (to remind us of all that we had seen). I would have liked even more details and historical facts, but then maybe that is just me :-). I also really liked it that the sales pitches were super gentle (like to buy another tour, or to eat at the restaurant where we had our break, etc).  I would certainly recommend this walking tour.",9

41318,"Tim, our tour guide, was great! He was very knowledgeable and you could tell he was passionate about his knowledge! Definitely felt like we had the VIP experience on the Beermaster tour.

21830,"Well organised, with lovely employees. Logan, our tour guide, was knowledgeable without being too wordy. He spoke clearly and was attentive to the needs of the group. He also taught us how to appreciate the whisky during the tasting session. The shop was well laid out and had a good range of products. Good coffee in your cafe and a helpful lady who found us a 'local' when she couldn't answer my question about a walk. A lovely morning, in all. Thank you. ",10

21906,"Guia maravillosa, visita corta pero intensa",8
21899,The tour was absolutely great. Nikos is extremely cool and relaxing guy. He spreads environment awareness in an exceptional way. The food we had for a lunch was unbelieveble. The places and beaches we have visited were absolutely stunning. This was our first time ever to try a kayak and we loved it. Snorkeling was also super fun. I hope they will continue with this tours in the years to come.  ,10
5072,"The guide was very good, kept the tour entertaining and not dull. However, it would have been better if the start of the tour would have had some history of the city in a timeline manner, i.e. from Vienna/ Austria BC to AD",8
21919,"Hello,  we took part in both the Free walking tour an the Beer Tour. The Free walking tour with Vaclav was a lot of fun and we learned very much about Prague, so we would give a 10. The Beer Tour with James was not bad, but we didn't learn much about Czech beer and traditions, and so it was too expensive in our opinion (0,5 l beer is just 40 crowns ...). Herefore we would give only a 4, so in average it is a 7.  Greets!",7
39536,"Great tour, Bubba was a fun guide.",10

8832,"Tome el walking tour con Magdalena y fue maravilloso, lo que me llevo a contratar el tour en español al palacio schonbrun, lamentablemente Uds. ecid incluyeron un grupo alemán (sin consultarnos) con lo cual se convirtio en una experiencia horrible y así lo haré saber en tripadvisor",4

22036,"the dance instructor Patrick was great. the only disappointment we had, was the fact, that we had booked a private workshop for a couple with TWO instructors and we only had one instructor.",9
5005,Very explanatory guide through the city and the passion of our guide-girl for her job was obvious in the way she spoke about each spot of the city. I was fascinated!,10
5079,"Helpful guide, efficient",10
5057,,10
5619,"From the first moment, the guide (Magdalena) was unfriendly, mean and even rude to the group. She clearly didn´t want to be there that morning. She started the tour with reluctance, in a very boring way. We almost could not hear her. When we asked her for speaking a little bit louder she just told us: ""better submit a complaint to the speaker's company"" (referring to the device she was using). That was very rude. Her explanations had not sense. She just explained where we are, the buildings we had around... no historical context, nothing interesting... After 20 minutes we decided to leave the group. We felt we were wasting our time following that woman who spoke almost whispering on purpose and who was giving us very bad explanations.   Sorry to say this was the worst experience we ever had with a tour. We were very disappointed as we love taking tours to know more about the places we visit and we missed the opportunity to do it this time.  I really hope Sandemans starts to work in Vienna very soon and tourists and visitors can enjoy proper good tours!   If you have a chance, please tell Miss Magdalena she is a terrible guide and she shouldn´t work on this anymore.",0

We really enjoyed learning about the history of the brewery and the different beer styles, particularly what is meant by ""steam"" beer.  Jarred did a great job with the history lesson, and a great job explaining the styles originated by Anchor that have spread throughout the country.   We really enjoyed our time at your brewery.",10

5589,"The tour was very exciting and interesting! Viena is a very nice city with many things to see, but this tour helps you with a very detailed overview, which allows you to go deeper afterwords depending on what you are interested in (history, art, architecture, etc...) Our guide (Eva) was very well prepared, her explanations were very clear and she was putting a lot of passion on her explanations which helps keeping up the attention. Highly recommended!",10

22166,Jared out guide was awsome and knowledgeable. I learned a lot about the beer and had an enjoyable time ,9
22303,Wonderful museum.  Great walking tour.  The only improvement we could suggest about the walking tour is that you become more competitive with TMMK (Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky) and ride your tour guests on a tram instead of walking them on a marketed path which is frequently interrupted by equipment sitting in the way.,10
5967,"The booking was easy, directions to meeting point good, organising into groups well done and Lada our guide was excellent. He gave us a lot of background history with plenty of little details to bring things to life and keep everyone amused and interested for 3 hours!",10

22885,"Went for a 3 hr. Good Vienna tour. A lot of history, culture, the city during, and after Nazi, music...great information. Our tour guide Lada, really nice and informative. However, we could barely hear him and had to read his lips to understand what he was saying. Also, his monotonous tone made us zone out from time to time.  There were about 35 people most of whom randomly showed up. I would highly recommend the Good Vienna Tour group to take less people so that the tour guide can be heard and the tour can be enjoyable. Thank you ",3

Thank you ,10
22251,I'm a visitor from Brazil and had an amazing experience in Anchor Brewing. I was already a fan of the beer and after knowing the history behind it and how it's made in SF just made a huge difference. On top of that was the incredible guide that was very cordial and funny. Thank you Joao for the great experience. Cheers!,10
22294,"The Honda Assembly Plant Tour in Marysville, OH is a wonderful way to spend the morning!  I have always been fascinated by cars and motorcycles.

22334,"Mike gave a tour that was was captivating: he was entertaining and educational at the same time, a difficult feat. Having an engaging and educated guide is a big plus. His personal stories made the tour. I also like that he didn't make fun of where people were from (like teasing Americans because of Donald Trump) just to get a cheap laugh.  We had a great time.",10

My suggestion is, don't change anything....the tour is fantastic made better with the ""then"" knowledge that it was a local business, surviving because of love and dedication.  Business is business.....we all know.  But they'd be wise not to change anything or push the buyout.",10

5966,"It was very good, and our tour guide, Claudia, she showed and explained a lot of the Austrian history. I loved it, twas very informative and definitely would recommend to others as well!",10
6088,"It was correct. We have been in many free walking tours before so we know how it works and we have experienced several guides. In this case, I think that it was too basic. The guide have focused too much in dates instead of facts. I think that it would have been more interested if there were more historical information. For example, we walk to St Esteban Cathedral and we didn't even enter. she should have talked a bit more about its construction. Another point it is that the guide was not opened to receive questions. It looked like we bother her.  The idea to do this kind of tours in Vienna is really good but it has to improve a lot. ",6

I have a guy in my group who walks very slow. Kathy asked if he wanted a cart about a quarter way through the tour. This was a fantastic help.",10

6873,"There were A LOT a people to do the tour, and there was a break of almost 30 minutes in the middle of the tour... why ?! We were not able to stay during all the tour because of this break (we had another visit planned after).  The good point is that we had a good guide. She had an Ipad to show us pictures et videos to have more informations on some points. ",5
6631,"Ursela was an amazing guide, very knowledgeable and enthousiatic. The only minor moint is that the prices she mentioned for some sights were all more expensive than the price she quoted. So Ursela keep up the good work, but update your prices. Eg elevator in Stephansdom is 5.5 euro in stead of 4...",9

40576,We need to do this more often! This was a great event!,10
22704,Excellent tour ,8
22649,I meant to put an 7.  I did not feel there was enough check in or markings on the trail.  I also think there should be more warnings about the entirely rocky path.  There is not comfortable without boots.  Would have been nice to purchase a shirt that said we survived! Was thankful for the people who had the shuttle to the boat which was 2 euros. Best money ever spent! The bus back did not have A/C on & we were hot in back.,10
42769,Ultra friendly folks.  Laura and Carly were perfect hosts and very knowledgeable.  We got to visit all of the stallions which I’ve not been able to do before.  California Chrome is one of the most accomplished horses in history and he looks magnificent in person.  We were able to feed him cookies!,10

70216,The guides are very knowledgeable and make the tour interesting ,10

Bijay was an awesome guide!  He was professional, informative, and very safety conscious. Mendeev, the porter, was always smiling, and made the trip fun.  I would use Nepal Eco Adventure again and recommend them to friends and family!!",10
22720,"The tour guide, Ken, was very friendly and he made a perfect tour but the only site of the tour that captched our interest was the locker rooms of warriors. ",6
6373,"The person organizing the group of people at the begining seemed really rushed/unorganized resulting in over 40 people in the group. Also we left part way through because you couldn't hear the guide and the group was just too big. She mentioned if you felt it was too big to just come back tomorrow but through our first section of the guide talking, 4 people showed up who had been directed to come that afternoon because it was too full in the morning. Disappointing because we even booked online for the 2 PM walk. ",2

12820,We had a great tour with Rafa. We learned lots about the city and the history. Thank you :),10
22729,We loved being able to actually walk through the different floors and be able to see everything from brewing to packaging. They also are very generous with beers to taste and are super knowledgable about the product!,10

22702,"Nice to hear about the history, tour was cool and the beer is always good.",10
22721,"Great experience, a friendly staff, and excellent beer.",10
22691,I though the tour was not so much a tour. We stood for an hour and I did not feel like we really got a tour of how it was all made at your location. Felt more like science class than touring a distillery. ,5
59105,"At first I thought $25/person seemed high because even though the tour was great, it wasn't too terribly long. Although the friendliness of our guide, the amount of Anchor Brewing beers that we were able to sample, and the discount we could receive at the public taps made it well worth the money. My partner and I are local to the Potrero Hill neighborhood, but definitely would plan on bringing visitors back for this tour. ",9
71126,"Loved this tour!  Duncan the tour guide was knowledgeable, set a great pace, and was fun to listen to.  Price was right, samples were great, and enjoyed the freebies.  Hope you will consider making this a regularly scheduled event.",10

11008,"El guía, un brasileño que cree hablar español, es muy poco pfofesional, no explica claramente las cosas, y no tiene un hilo conductor para hacer la guiada. Muy mediocre y mal preparado. Dijo haber estufiado tres años para ser guía. No se nota.",2

6569,Very rude organizer. Guide had plenty of knowledge but boring,0
6804,The tour guide was really interactive. ,8
14375,Nacho was a very good guide. But for a break in the shopping we had to spend half an hour waiting for some people queueing up to buy some tickets for another tour. Marketing for your company is ok but wasting time waitting nothing is not a good deal.,8
14378,"We took 3 good Prague tours.   The City tour, the Castle district, and the Communist tours.  All were great, and better than the private tours we took in some other European cities. The paid tours with other tour operators tended to have older customers, generally retirees.  The 'free' companies follow a different business model based on 'pay for quality' so the guides have skin in the game.  Don't forget to tip well!!! Mike and Kamil were great. ",10
40579,Event was well planned and organized.  ,10
22752,Amazing people and tour! Everyone was so friendly and the beers we tasted were awesome!! ,10

22861,"The tour was wonderful and informative. Our guide Jamie was really fun too, he made sure to include my wife who isn't a whiskey fan. My wife had a good time too. I also like the idea that if you are the driver you can have your tastings in a ""take away"" container to enjoy later when you are not driving. Best distillery tour ever! ",10

It was a very interesting presentation and it showcased the high level of creativity and talent at Alesmith. He and the other staff at Alesmith made us feel welcome and at home. We're excited about the future for Alesmith and your beer is on our top list of go-to beverages! ,10
33663,"I am from the Fort Worth, TX area an there are many breweries in the area.  None of them I have been to even compare to Ale Smith.

We hoped to be makin some tastes and buying some beers and soveniers from gift shop, but the last call was minutes after we finished the tour. We are felling lime shout out from there. And the girl at the gift shop was soo rude with us, since we came before start the tour. We went from Brazil, dreamin enjoy all the visit, but thats not happend at all.",6

22821,Great tour!  Tastings were delicious.,10

Diego made our trip amazing.... and Marta topped it off perfectly!",10

22919,Very enjoyable,9
22851,"We were very specifically told this was a private tour.  I asked and was assured ""it will be just the 2 of you"". This was important for me because I have a disc problem in my back and I intended to sit up front where I could brace myself and protect my back.  We arrived at Sani pass to be assigned back seats in a 9 passenger vehicle.  This wasn't a mistake, we were lied to and the guides at Sani pass told me the group tour is what Tim Brown had booked for us.  It was not an enjoyable experience. ",2
34268,"The atv tour was great. Well maintained new atv’s and spectacular scenery.  Kine was also an excellent guide. Very professional and always focused on our safety and well being.  I know we will have a different guide, but we booked another tour with your company today because of his  recommendation.(this time the crocodile tour)  We are very impressed with AXR and Kine has a lot to do with it.

140929,Very nice program.  SCAD is not for everyone.  One needs to want to Pursue a BAF.  I know medical is outsourced.  It would be worth having a medical rep at the questions and answer session.,8
22948,Hitlers Vienna. ..Hitler sells? A guide who likes to portrait the Austrians as resistance fighters and victims? Come on....,0

Can't wait to get our hands on the new Coffee Porter!",10
22962,"Our team had a great time at Anchor!  They liked the lose feeling of the tour and the fact that we were so up close and personal.  Letting them just sit and chat over beer afterwards was great too.  I mean, who doesn't love a basically open bar while socializing with people they haven't seen in months?  Overall awesome!  Thanks for everything!",10

22989,Awesome variety of beer. Tour was thorough and enjoyable - our group learned a lot. Speakeasy room was a very nice surprise. Barrel-aged beers were a treat. Nice to have a food truck on-site to pair with the beer. Having food available allowed us to stay longer and drink more. Our group had a great time at AleSmith. Looking forward to CheeseSmith!,10
42803,"The tour guide was great, it was more in the tour itself.  We were only able to see two barns, and not much of the grounds.  It would have been nicer to learn more about the farm than just the lineage of each stallion.",5
42772,"Great to look at what can happen when you work hard, as Mr Honda did, all the tech from rather humble beginnings of light motorcycles to Jets..Very spotless, Jim was a delight, PS also had to take my 2018 2.0 Accord Sport back to where it was made....",10
23073,1st big thank you to Priscilla for special deal and all co-operation. The expierence was awsum. We all enjoyed alot.   Regards Murtuza ,9

42774,Fast and quick tour but definitely a must to try the beers and the tap room across the stree A+. ,10
6541,Groups a little too big to hear everything,7
8175,Libor was great,9
241601,The instructor was great.  She went through the activity and repeated the activity multiple times because some were behind.  There was someone monitoring the chat box to acknowledge the comments and the speed in which the instructor needed to follow.  ,8
23003,Bart was a superb guide. Knowledgeable and spoke very good English. He had just the right amount of information and anecdotes. The tour of the old city was excellent. We learned so much about the city and history of Poland. Highly recommended. ,10
40005,"The driver was falling asleep while driving us around the safari. He stated that he was tired from being up at 4am. We likely missed out on a lot of viewing opportunities because of his exhaustion. We did not learn much about the animals or the park. He would stop for a minute and just have us take pictures, without giving information. Instead he told us a lot of stories regarding his experiences at another game reserve during walking tours. We proceeded to have lunch at the Hilltop camp but after an hour when we were ready to leave we could not locate the driver. We were all waiting in the car for him to finish his break. In addition, he frequently took breaks to talk on his cell phone not only in the game reserve but also at gas stations on the ride to and from the hotel in Durban. This was very unprofessional and not safe. ",5
39553,"Had a fun time with a small group, but sometimes there was not clear guidance and too much “down time.”",8

23174,None in our party liked the Whiskey,0
6675,"Our guide could have been a little more animated and charismatic and created more rapport with the group throughout the tour. Some of the questions about public education were answered in monosyllables and we personally would have liked more insight on those topics. I also strongly disliked that you persecuted people the way you did for joining the tour in the last minute. If a couple of extra people tagged along it would have had no incidence on the rest of the group. The excuse of protecting the guides voice was used. If that is the concern you should wire the guides up with small speakers, like they do in other cities.  Even though the tour is advertised to be ""free"" everybody pays. Instead of paying in advance in the beginning of the tour for something we don't know, we pay at the end of the tour with the benefit of being able to put the value to it ourselves. More than scores from 0 to 10, the contributions on average per tour should be a true representation of the quality of the tour! Kind regards,  Imre and Jules ",7
23084,Because the guide   told us about history in a structured way and with a lot of relevant information.,10
124113,We were very impressed with the intimacy of the operation.  Its great to know that a true family operation still exists and produces such great Bourbon and Rye!,10

23186,"There was a big, impenetrable group around the guide prior to the tour. We were polite and waited for it to disperse a little. No need to rush, we had reservations. Once we made our way to the guide, we learned they gave our reservations to other people because we ""didn't show up in time"".",0

23228,Nothing to report this time. ,10
23229,"The distillery setup is very well done. The tour was very informative and gave some insight into how things worked and what their plans for the future hold. Seems like they have put a lot of thought into the business plan, it will be interesting to watch them as their plans unfold. Awesome craft cocktails and tastings of the current and soon to be available whiskeys. The food vendor available was great too, very innovative offerings. ",10

Love seeing the progress and expansion. Got to purchase bourbon this time, the first visit no bourbon, 2nd time it was sold out. We also like the rum and vodka.",10

23253,"Our tour guide, Paul, was really rude and disrespectful. As soon as we arrived, he doubted that we paid and and humiliated us infront of everyone, although I have booked these tickets weeks ago. Then he didn't even apologize for the way he spoke to us, and discriminated against us. We were the only ones that are from out of town and the only ones he treated that way or even asked for proof of payment. Then the tour was purely about him and we were there to learn about beer, not his beer chugging competitions. His manners were unexisting, beers great but the experience was terrible. ",0

23385,"My ride with Montefusco was as perfect as could be possibly imagined. Ernesto is an ex national junior champion and a wonderful guide who gave me a fabulous one-one 60k 1300m tour of the spectacular climbs and descents around Barcelona. Weather was also perfect but I could not have enjoyed a motning on a bike more. Martin (Bristol, UK)",10
40596,"It was a nice way to show appreciation to the employees, allow employees to learn a little more about the craft partners and try their products, and provide a setting for employees to bond in a social setting outside of working hours",10
23324,"Did this tour 10 years ago. Intelligent and informative guides each time. Also reinforces what I forget from time to time, Anchor makes dang good local beer. When the market is so saturated and we are all picking up the new styles, etc. Anchor will always be one of choices for a six pack when I need something sessionable and consistent. Christmas ain't Christmas until I buy seasonal ale. Thanks. ",10

Edina was very kind an recommendend, crosed every sightseeing point in my citymap, so that we could easily find all the things afterwards.

7424,"My mum and I have previously been on a Good Krakow Tour, which was fantastic and hosted by two young students. I couldn't recommend that tour highly enough. I expected the same warm reception and passion from the Vienna equivalent. However, the tour guide made snide comments about my mum and myself 'not paying attention' which was grossly misled. There were several other disruptive members of the tour who got away with being distracting and rude. The tour guide also made what could be considered xenophobic comments regarding street beggars, claiming that 'you won't see an Austrian person on these streets, they're all Romanian'. This tour directly impacted on my perception of the city unfortunately. The tour guide was rude and abrupt and I would hate for anyone else to be subject to the same experience. ",2

7475,"I really liked the stories and history Kris shared with us, but that also hindered how far the tour could take us. Sometimes the prioritization of the stops we made seemed less important to the historical sites of the city. But overall I really enjoyed the tour and what Kris shared with us. ",7
7431,"guide was knowledgeable, answered all my questions and tour has all the main sites one needs to see in Vienna",10
7594,The tour guide was bad in storytelling and he asked questions and I felt like stupid not to knowing answers.,4
7926,The tour guide was very informative. I wish we covered more ground during the walking tour.,8
8048,"I have done lots of walking tours and honestly I was not happy with this one. The tour guide was providing more historical information rather than taking us to different places. He specified the last part of the tour to discuss today issues/situation of Vienna which I think was totally irrelevant to the aim of a walking tour. Also giving people 30min break was quite unusual!!! The tour guide was really respecful, knowledgeable and reflective but I imagine some changes have to be done to make the tour closer to a common walking tour",2

23620,"My husband and I had such an unique experience with Valtournative.  The wine vineyard destination was authentic and true to the region of Valencia and Spain as a whole.  We were looking for an escapade that didn't feel too ""touristy"", and we hit the jackpot with Daniel and his company.  He directly picked us up from our hotel and dropped us off which was fantastic and convenient.  We spent a beautiful day touring a working-family's wine vineyard and having the most tasty, appetizing, snacks and most importantly WINE.  The wine pours were very generous at this vineyard, not like some other wine tastings I've experienced where their 'stingy' on the wine pours.  They were very generous with their snacks and wines!  There were stuffed olives, chips, chocolate, bread and fresh, handmade, olive oil from the wine vineyard! The information Daniel provided was detailed and educative but not too exhaustive or ""boring"" with a constant fun vibe always creating this jovial atmosphere.   He even made a stop at a neighboring town where we all shared a delicious lunch with food local to the area.  My husband and I truly enjoyed getting to know Daniel and that just added another level of personalization to the experience which we really cherished!  I highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a full-bodied, educative, fun, authentic, cultural, ""true to Spain"" tour!!  Daniel was professional, fun, warm, smart, and educated us a lot about Spain culture and WINE.  Fun fun fun!  DO IT!  =)    Best, Michelle & Evan",10

23942,There was no true understanding or commitment to whiskey culture demonstrated by the tour guide. I was willing to over look this until I saw that your bottled product is diluted and infused white dog. I feel like it is a bad start with low integrity. I wanted to believe in an Austin bourbon.

The facilities are amazing, the drinks are delicious and the entire staff is passionate and friendly. It was a great vibe from the moment we walked in. We are honored to be part of the very first tour!! Everyone needs to support this local gem ",10
29837,Great trip with Narayan!,10
29939,Booking process not a pleasant experience. Your card is charged immediately when making an enquiry without them confirming first. I would strongly suggest booking directly with the manager and via a tourist operator. Also the 35km trip covers more sights than the 50km trip.,7
29945,Would be great if the brewing/ fermentation  process be shared ,5

29811,"The factory tour was awesome!!  10/10.   The heritage center was slow moving and seemed to waste a lot of time.  Tour was slow to get started and could have gone without the 30-45 minutes to walk around the museum after the PowerPoint and before the factory tour.  Especially when most of the tour participants arrived early enough to walk around the museum several times anyways.  But overall, very interesting and would return.",8
29827,The staff was very knowledgable and the facility was great! Thanks Still Austin Whiskey!,10

8131,"This was a really good tour. We enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it. Particularly liked the architectural aspects of Rainer's dialogue. He covered architecture, history, food and modern day Austria.  He gave us come tips about restaurants and we are going to follow theses up. I didn't realise up until yesterday that he has to deal with a diverse group of people___ culturally and linguistically. When he asked how many people knew of Gustav Klimt we were surprised that only four of the roughly 30 people knew of this.  All in all a very good guide and lots of information and beautiful buildings to admire. Columba and ELizabeth Boyack ",10
29788,Nancy was knowledgeable and enthusiastic but I see more animals in my hotel patio every morning than we saw in 2 hours of walking in the rain. The tour is too expensive. ,5

40884,Enjoyed the tour guides and had a very memorable experience.  The school was fun and light-hearted.  This was our first visit to the new beer garden and visitor's center and found it to be a very impressive venue.  We left after the visit and promised ourselves we would definitely come back soon...when its a little warmer.,10
40611,"Great atmosphere (i.e. food options, music, other entertainment).  Setting worked out as there was plenty of space for interaction with other employees to network and fortunately weather was in favor of the event. Would be good to consider the weather as well for future planning.",10
40603,Was an amazing event!,10
39672,Very good guide who had a lot of knowledge! Interesting tour and good tasting at the end. 25 dollars is maybe a little bit to expensive 15-18 would be more reasonable.,9

8327,"We learned a lot from our guide (sorry forgot his name), but sometimes his stories or answers were a bit too elaborate or even repetitive, which made it hard to keep your attention. Also, the promotion of the other tours was lengthy. However, you could tell that the guide had a lot of knowledge, very impressive!  Maybe a tip: many people do not want to do 2 tours in 1 day, so maybe provide people with the option to sign up for the castle tour of the next day with your special discount.",7
8267,"DIeter was a superb guide--knowledgeable and made the story and details sensible.  This was the kind of information walk I expected. My only criticism was with the meeting point. Given that there were so many other tour groups there at the same time, it was a challenge to find the company. Why not meet across the street at the Jewish memorial?",9
29921,Well I had a great time with you and your company. The only thing was sigthseeing in Bakhtapur. We were two times in rushhour traffic. That was not so fine. But I don`t know if the traffic better on another time? Otherwise it was a perfect trip. All was perfect organized. We had a super Guide with Raj. Thank you.,9

12487,"Because the tour Was very uncomplete, it was only about a little part of the heart of the Town. The guide spoke very bad spanish and hasn't enough knowledge. He hadn't prepared the visit, the explanations were quite superficial. We didn't learnt almost anything about the town or the austrian history. Before, we had visited Prague and we took all the tours and were very good and learnt a lot.",0

41271,We drove over three hours to get there. We got there very early. We knew to dress warm since part of tour would be very cold. Lady in our group was carrying around her own sweatshirt brought from home. She was killing time in the gift shop. Then we sat just outside the shop on some seats. Then a gift shop lady and police officer came out to ask why she hadn’t paid for the sweatshirt!!! Very smart aleck attitude of the gift shop lady! No apology when they realized they were wrong!! Ruined the whole trip!!!! Hate St Louis. We’ll never go back but will tell everyone how unfriendly St Louis is!!! DISGUSTING!!!,0

40974,Great guide!,10
40826,"I’ve done the beermaster tour before and the bud light tour was absolutely not worth any of the money spent on it.  The tour guide was rude. She rushed through the tour so much that at every stop we caught up with the group in front of us. After each stop she was basically run to the next stop and not answer questions. She talked extremely fast and it was easy to tell she did not like her job. Maybe it was just a bad day, but she did not seem like a person that should have a customer facing job. I like to take people to AB when they visit from out of town, but don’t think I will be back anytime soon. ",0

I am not a beer drinker, but knowing how beer is made was shocking, in a good way. I would have never thought in a million years that beer is from yeast, rice, malt, and water. I was soooo amazed!",10
40927,"It was a good experience, but there were a lot of crying children and strollers that made it hard to hear what was being said. It was also a very full tour, which increased the issue of being close enough to the tour guide to hear. Although we had the last tour of the day, our guide seemed unenthusiastic and spoke quickly sometimes, again making it hard to hear anything. ",6

10597,"I love walking tours, I try to do one in every city I visit. I think they are very informative and resourceful. However, I must say, after 8 months of traveling, this is potentially the least favorite tour I've taken. I felt that we walked by a lot of important buildings/ monuments but our tour guide never pointed them out. Instead the tour foucussed on a lot of random signs, restaurants, shops...it just didn't feel helpful. Previous walking tours have been great, sort of help layout the city, but this one just felt odd. Plus, our tour guide conducted the tour in Spanish but his Spanish was difficult to understand. By the way, I elected to take the Spanish tour since it's my first language. Hope this review is helpful! Thank you!",6

Like how many beechwood barrels there are in the whole plant, etc.  Is Budweiser and bud lite made all over or just in St. Louis, and what happens when you guys buy out a smaller brewery.

30654,Super informative about the beer making process. Ava was a great tour guide and we learned a lot about anchor steam. We totally recommend this tour.,10

30834,"Staff knowledge of beers, production, and brewery history.  Beautiful tasting room, and excellent beers to sample.  Very enjoyable tour/tasting ",10
30780,The visit is fun and interesting. And for a foreign it is an excellent opportunity to visit something outside the traditional tourists activities.,10
39707,The tour was sold out and I decided to view the video and the tasting. The total of the tasting was not even one shot and for the money it was overpriced!,4
30848,Great staff that was passionate about the industry.  Great tasting room and ample time to try the beers.,10
10110,"Recommendations led us to tourist traps, and we didn't learn anything about Vienna. All the tour was about was buildings and when they were constructed. A little bit about the royal family, not a lot about the history of Austria itself",4

30803,I had a great tour guide who was a lot of fun on the tour and very knowledgeable on the history and making of Anchor beer. The tasting after was great - I didn't think we'd be able to try so many different types of the beer! ,10

30713,Informative and fun,10
39600,"Great beer, great tour",10
30828,Jeremias was an excellent guide! He was very knowledgeable about the animals and plants. We had him for both the tour of Manuel Antonio and the Night Mangrove Tour. Jeremias was funny and full of very interesting information and stories. There were young children in our tour of the park and he was very patient with them and made sure everyone got to see what we were looking at and could take pictures. We did not know food was included in the tours so that was an excellent surprise! We highly recommend Jade Tours!!!,10

43610,"Had a great time on the Bud Light tour. Our guide was very friendly and informative.  Would have been better without (disinterested, aka noisy/whiny) kids in the group, but worth the time and money! ",10

30936,Tour guide was very nice and knowledgeable.,10
40644,"Very good layout but only a few spaces outside to sit, did not understand that the tour center was wide open with food until the very end.  Communication was a little light going in to educate us with that to expect.  Thanks",7
30855,"it was waste of time . you said small group of 12 then you get there and is 30 plus ,very un welcome and have to tell people before hand that you have to pay for beer after the 3 beer testing at no so cheap price ",1
41309,Loved the tour and tasting,10
30877,I meant to rate you a ten out of ten but my thumb hit the 9 accidentally. Juan our tour guide was great!!!!! It was the perfect way to begin our time in Costa Rica.  We loved it!,9
10548,The group was too large ,6
30701,"Porque yo reservé tour en español. Y resulta q al presentarnos en la hora y sitio indicado el tour era en inglés. En la página suya indican q es español, pero no lo es así. Por lo q estoy descontenta con ello",0

30928,"Había muy poca comida por persona, la comida era muy pobre y el desayuno ""bufet"" siempre se acababa y alguien se quedaba sin comer. En general la gente con la que hablamos pasaba hambre igual que nosotros.  Las habitaciones no estaban mal, pero tampoco era una locura. Con el guía no tuvimos ningún problema. Aunque los conocimientos que tenían sobre la fauna y flora del lugar eran superficiales, parecía que escucháramos una grabadora en reperat. No nos gustó el trato del administrador, que nos miraba como si todos los gringos fueramos un dolar andando sin neuronas. No está mal pero por lo que se cobran ya podrían alimentarte mejor..",6

128635,"Liked the tour, especially the tastings scattered along the tour root.",8
40641,"The setup, flow, food, and drinks were awesome. It was wonderful to meet the people who work in the craft breweries. I thought bringing everyone together for an event everyone could enjoy was fantastic, especially since senior leadership was in town to enjoy and mingle with the STL folks as well. THANK YOU!!!",10
30953,"It was a bit boring to be frank, and definitely not worth the cost, especially considering it was really a promo for anchor products.  It would have been much more interesting to hear from someone actually involved in the process and definitely to have had a tour.  I've visited 209 to drop something off once and I learned more and saw more, and they don't even do tastings or tours.",3
40781,"Great experience, great staff, jess was lovely, well worth travelling from the UK to NYC and brooklyn, it's a gem, best of all the beers are superb. ",10

10729,Langweilig erzählt ,2
31019,We arrived 10 minutes later at the meeting point for an inconvenience at the hotel and Magdalena in very bad shape in front of the whole group asked us to leave. I would never recommend the tour for this treatment.,0
42061,Tour was excellent all round. Really enjoyed the experience. Tour guide and all staff very welcoming and knowledgeable ,9
42781,"The tour was awesome! It was great to learn about the history, learning how the beer was made was super interesting and engaging, and the samples at the end of the tour were amazing!",10
128628,It was a very interesting tour. Informative and fun. Our guides Kayla and Jason where very knowledgeable and accommodating. Enjoyed the Greatest beer in the world and did a little shopping too. Only wish we personally had had more time to spend looking around. Will definitely be back. Thank you.,10
31052,"Great guide - Tina was Great, really cheery and perfect representative. Nice amount of time. Wasn't rushed. Good cocktails. We had a superb time and will recommend to friends!!",10
11908,"The tour, although 2 hours long, was very brief and did not give an in depth insight on the history and culture of Vienna. Instead it was more like a summary of what is nice to do in Vienna and perhaps a short snippet of the significance of certain building (spoiler alert these building aren't really the most significant ones in Vienna. We didn't cover the significance of any of the palaces). Having said that, I did enjoy the tour. It was a nice walk through Vienna and I somewhat did enjoy myself. Would only recommend if you have not don't poor research in Vienna. It is a good introduction to Vienna but not a good exploration of the city. ",5
11088,It wasnt that great,5
31108,My family had the best time!! My child got separated from us and the staff was amazing about helping find her!! Thanks so much!,10

31132,"Great tour, very informative, beautiful facility.",10
31192,"The tour was good, but the tasting was superb!",10
13693,Compared to the previous walking tours it was quite boring. May be your regular guides were on leave on Sunday. More focus was on collecting generous tips rather than any value addition or sharing trivia on the history ,2
11400,"I did not like to tour very much, sorry.",6
59139,"I LOVED THE EXPERIENCE, BUT AT THE END WE DIDNT RECEIVED DE GLASES THAT WE WERE TOLD WE WOULD GET. BUT IT WAS GREAT ANYWAY!",10
31120,We expected to walk a little bit more in order to see more. The guide told us to much details. ,5
31185,"Kinda turned off by a girl who threw up in during the start of our tour last Saturday. “It” got on my cousins shoes and we left the tour to clean up, we didn’t return to the tour and lost the group. I dont know if she was served too much, had a stomach virus, or what, but it’s a negative experience I’ll never forget. Shame, as I was really excited to finally go on the tour and made a special trip up from Highlands Ranch. ",6
31196,Really nice tasting experience!,10
31143," All the staff are incredibly positive and knowledgeable, and just seem to be downright happy people! That, coupled with a wonderful product and tasting experience, really made it a fantastic time! ",10
31222,"It’s a glorified tasting in a bar. No plantation, factory or warehouse tour and the “tour” consisting of 1 room and then a video covering the exact same topic is uninspired ",3
31208,The tour and tasting was very fun and something different to do with friends.,10
31224, ,9
31220,Very nice tour. Thank you. New location is not so easy to find because there was no sing yet at the door.  ,9
41296,"The passion we saw in ALL of the workers in this distillery was truly refreshing!   We had never been whisky tasting before, and though they are still fairly new into the business it was still a great time! Everyone is so knowledgeable about the product they are handling, which was very helpful to someone who had never experienced this before.   After our tour and tasting, we ordered a bloody mary with the pepper whiskey and I can truly say it was like no other bloody mary I had had before! Would definitely visit for cocktails and bring friends for the tours again!",10
41356,Incredible place to visit. The facility js beautiful and the people are fantastic. Its a wonderful experience for all.,10
41430,Friendly and knowledgeable tour guides. ,10
41429,"The visitor's center is lovely, as is the whiskey. The only thing I would change is to include some rarer bottles in the tasting.",10
31240,the guide was friendly and knowledgeable.  i learned so much and had a great time.,10
31301,I think having the ability to drink during the tour and not have it back loaded would be best. ,8
41317,"We had a relatively small group of 7 people for our tour and our tour guide, Jon, was able to answer all of our questions.  In addition Jon was able to give a a more personal behind the scenes tour with such a small group.  Definitely would do it again.",9
11535,Porque el guía era brasileño y su castellano no era muy nítido y no se le entendía bien. Los puntos de interés que nos mostró creo que fueron incompletos.,5
31285,Really good experience with a lot of rum to taste. I was hoping for slightly a more in depth tour with the showing of how the rum is made etc however it was still well worth it.,8
31293,It was fantastic! Great information and had such a fun time,10
11622,Poor spanish level ,6
14675,"The tour was supposed to be in Spanish but the guide was brazilian. His Spanish wasn´t very good so very often it was difficult to follow the conversation. Therefor, there wasn´t any interaction from the public, and that made the tour slightly boring. I missed more practical information about the dayly life in Viena (for example events during the summertime).",5
31310,I did not like the taste of any of the 6 liquors I sampled. ,1
31284,Good effort in locating wildlife and close up views. Nice lunch venue. Friendly/informative tour guide. ,10
31289,"Just the overall experience was excellent. If you enjoy beer & history, this tour is for you!",10
31306,"As far as beer quality I give it an 8.  The tour was a bit drab.  Lots of historical information but little detail on beer making process.  Tell a story, what makes Anchor unique, why do I want to drink your beer over others.  The tour was to be 1.5 hours long.  I did not expect to be tasting beer for an hour.  ",6
31322,"Jared gave us a fantastic tour, tasted non comercial beers! Fantastic tour",10
11615,"Knowledgeable tour guide with perfect English,  though not enough of the major sites were covered. ",5
4184,"The guide for the tour was relaxed, but super informative. He did a beautiful job describing the distilling process for all of the liquors. And he described the tastes very well. During the samplings in the distillery itself.",10
31443,It was fun and very informative. ,10
67398,Great atmosphere and hospitality ,10
73256,An amazing experience!,10
31341,I thought it was a tour of the distillery so was a little let down. I would have appreciated mix being offered with the shots of rum as the first sample is not meant to be drank on it's own anyways. The tour guide was awesome!,6
31369,Really good insight to rum making. Also for $20 you got to taste a lot of rum too.,10
11533,"Instead of providing meaningful information about Vienna, its history, and its art and architecture, the guide wasted 2.5 hours telling us about schnitzel and the Funeral Museum. We got to the Judengasse and he said, ""This is the Judengasse. Though it's no longer called the Judengasse. Now it's called the Bermuda Triangle because of all of the people who get drunk here."" No information about the people, their culture, or their contribution to the city of Vienna before they were brutally exterminated. Very disrespectful.",0
40638,This was amazing to see many of our microbreweries and sample the product. It was also great to hang out with coworkers in a  non work environment and understand them better. Food was top notch this event made me happy to be part of the brewery team.,10
41353,We had so much fun! Great experience ,10
31383,The staffs were very kind even though we cannot understand completely the explanation.,10

31386,"Fun, relaxed tour that give the history of the brewery and the opportunity to taste the different beers they offer",10
31336,Jarred was an excellent tour guide and very knowledgeable!,10
31402,"Limited menu, after doing the tour and taste testing, one of the beers I tasted I just LOVED! But when I asked to have it with dinner I was told it was not available ad could not.  Waitress was very inattentive, we had to keep waving her down to get her to come to the table to take our orders/needs.  Also went to the comedy show, which was very disappointing as well.  After the show we went downstairs to have a final drink together and were told ""sorry we're not taking any more orders tonight""  it was a little after 9pm.  This was our first visit, I will not be returning.",3
31440,"Ramal was great, really funny. The whole experience was really well done enjoyed it very much. ",10
31412,The tour guide was excellent! The rum is good and really worth a visit.,9
31438,"Progressional, informative and friendly tour. Would have rather higher if we’d actually seen the distillery.",8
41298,"Friendly, knowledgeable and courteous. A relaxing small group experience ",10
124138,"An iconic distillery, great tasting experience. The guide could have given a little more history of bourbon.",10
31403,"Today my family did the taste of prague food tour with Marketa and  enjoyed every minute of it . Marketa was fantastic and informative , happy and friendly. The food was amazing , delicious , the venues were great and the service top notch at all of the places . Very well organised and ran smoothly despite our family going to the wrong meeting point to begin with and holding everyone up !!!!! It was however Marketa who made this food tour what it is . Thankyou Marketa we will be telling all our friends who are visiting Prague to do this tour !!! Awesome !!!! ",10
15892,"We went on the Hitler tour on Monday 24th July.  The weather was not great but as forecast started to clear as we set off. Good introduction at the holocaust memorial with the Jewish person being forced to clean the streets and the explanation. This was as good as it got. The guide set off at a great rate of knots, rushing to get everything in within the stated 2 and a 1/2 hours. The group moved toward a building/garden owned by the Hapsburg's. He then began to talk about a building built using money from the Jewish community. No clear link was made to Hitler or the tour, my own personal knowledge informs me of what was happening with the Jewish community at this time. We arrived at the University of Art, and were advised that Hitler had applied twice to attend and failed. We would see why, we would go in and have a look around. The next 15 minutes was nothing more than the guide telling stories of his family and their experience at this time, i.e. supporting the policies and being  anti-semetic. Hmm, a bit of different knowledge. We did not get to see why the application was rejected, neither did we look around inside. People were now looking very bored, I was! Additionally my  wife was having problems with her earpiece, it kept cutting out, a loose wire. At the first main road to cross, he hurried across the road at the crossing, leaving 5 people stuck as the lights changed. He did not check that all had crossed but continued along the road leading the group who had crossed. The lights took some 5 minutes to change by which time all sight of him had been lost. We caught up with the group at the next place of interest, as he was starting to leave! He continued on his merry way, ignoring the group that had just arrived. By now my wife had lost interest along with at least 5 others. We continued into the Heroes Square, beautiful, a brief explanation of Hitler returning and addressing a crowd of hundred thousand. We saw pictures of a and archived video footage played on his laptop.  More family stories, nothing about where he stayed in Vienna, or how how the people acted whilst he was there, was it different when he left. We moved to another memorial built to commemorate the political victims. Members of the group were impressed, but as cameras came out, away he went, rapidly walking away! Moving onto the Jewish Quarter, notes about the memorial there and the Synagogue, nothing about the Jewish Museum, to our minds would warrant a brief visit as we had plenty of time left on the tour. We continued to the only remaining Jewish Synagogue during the war years and still in use, a passing mention wa made by him and we had the building pointed / shown from the top of the street, we went back to take a proper look after the tour, as we had no chance during the tour. We just heard more boring family stories, no real history. Finally we arrived at a vantage point overlooking the river, this was we were told the location of the infamous Hotel Metropole. If we took a look between 2 trees we would see the only 2 remaining  stones. People were asking where, there was the response. Where someone else asked, there between the two trees. No sign of these two stones could be seen, even venturing down to the street level and scouring the area afterwards. However, before we ventured down we were told, that is it, the tour is done, barely 2 hours from the start. On turning from where we finished, we came upon the oldest church in Vienna, St Ruperts. No mention was made of this historic church or the fact that it was in the oldest part of the city, with Roman roots! HISTORY or not. Worst tour I have ever experienced with little to no fact just family stories and a bit of archive footage¬ not worth the money and no recommendations.",3
31483,"We met Joey in Casco Viejo and during the tour , he showed us places off the beaten path and we loved it ! He took us to a place called Lo Que Hay , and we loved this place . The food was fantastic; we wouldn’t never found this place . We took the metro back to the city and we went to a coffee house where we had coffee and pastries . The whole tour was great . We highly recommend this tour for anybody whos visiting Panama . Thank you ",10

31466,"It was very well organized, really fun, and I felt like the staff was very generous with their time- they answered all our questions (Braedon was VERY knowledgeable!), they took their time giving us the tour (it didn't feel rushed at all), and they were really nice about letting us taste LOTS of different beers.",10
31419,"I think tour could be better. I've been in others breweries tours around the world, and Steam Whistle made too fast (maybe it's because you have only 1 type of beer). Also, you just have 2 beers - 1 bottle at the beginning and another one in the final. Normally, you have an opportunity to drink more in breweries. ",6
59147,Great tour and the beer was top rated,10
31498,"The three hour tour was so nice! We walked through the old and new town and the jewish quarter and we learned so much about the vast history of prague and the czech republic! Michael was a great host and tourguide. Witty, knowledgeable and fun. 10/10 recommend! Thanks again guys!!!",10
40639,"This was the best event I have been to at AB-InBev.  The variety in beer, food, and fun was superb!  The only thing that could have made it better is to hand out a little more swag or last longer in time. ",10

31513,"We really enjoyed learning about Honda in the US. I remembered American Honda, and I was interested to learn about how the name was changed to Honda of America. The cars and bikes were beautiful, especially the CRX. I do wish there was more information on the histories of the cars puchased from private owners. Part of what makes Honda so compelling owners who love their cars and bikes. We would love to see a whole room dedicated to HART. Maybe a room as big as the existing museum. We adore the whole concept of HART and think that it is one of the most Honda things you do.",10

31638,Such a great tour!! Thank you!!,10
31545,Too much hard sell. Not enough info on how rum is made   How about some machines with explanation  A couple of pieces of sugar cane for those visiting from resorts  A shop with a restaurant attached ,2
31661,Rumal was great guide. Drink making a blast.,10
42820,"The tour guide was fantastic! Meeting Jimmy Russell was the highlight of my day! Went to 3 distilleries before hand, and just meeting him blew everything else out of the water!",10
16065,"our guide, Will, was extremely informative and open to answering a lot of our questions. we enjoyed learning about the process, as well as the efforts of BMD to include sustainability as a part of their process. Will definitely be recommending to others!",9
43806,"The tour was informative and well designed.  We got to see the Clydesdale horses first, so children could be spared the rest of the tour.  Adults got to see the brewing process.  Then it was on to the samples!",10
31577,Great guide. The Kutna Hora tour was a good price (with the inclusion of transport) and very interesting and informative. ,10

31684,I loved that it was free and clean and so well done! Everything was well cared for And the story was excellent!!,10
31603,The tour was not as described.  Fast driving down a dirt road and no hiking or experiencing nature at all.  ,0
31724,"Very informative tour, it would not been beneficial to go to park without a guide.  Juan was an extremely perceptive and intuitive guide with excellent knowledge and a warm heart.  Beautiful tour!!! ",10
12267,"Although I am sure on other days this tour is great, on this day the tour was not good. The regular guide was ill, and our guide spent 15 minutes asking if anyone wanted to leave...???? Then we strolled around the Ring, and he pointed out a few points of interest and told two memorable stories about the Habsburg family. I mostly remember complaining about the lack of guides, and a reluctance to do any real work. It is a shame because it was my first exposure to Vienna. ",3
31644,friendly informative staff,9
21930,I di not find the guide well informed.  It was not my first visit to Vienna.  she was bouncy and pleasant but short on factual info.  She gave the more fairly tale version of vents that occurred.  Paula Zupnik,5
31731,The vodka was average for the price.  Out of the six flavors sampled in the tasting room only the Buddha hand citrus and Rose were above average. The chipotle vodka was not good (and I normally love chile vodka)... it doesn’t bode well to have the tour guide instruct you ‘not to smell’ the vodka before sampling. ,5
31743,"There were more than 50 % of the visitors from non English speaking countries. It would be nice if the guides would speak more slowly:-) It would have been nice to hear more about the 4 beers we've tasted. What is so special? What's the difference to other beers? You could start with the taste of 2 beers, than show the brewery and end with the taste of 2 beers.",5
39690,"It was a very good tour and our tour guide, Vivian?, did a good job.  She was very personable and told the bus about other things to do in the area.  Not just distilleries but other things as well. The bus makes it a lot easier to move around the facility. It was awesome to see Jimmy Russell in the gift shop!",9
39722,I had such a great time at Wild Turkey. The entire staff there was fabulous and made me feel like family. ,10
70232,The driving from Durban to Underberg was unsafe,5
31720,Jeremy gave us valuable information about plant and wild  life in the rainforest. He was open to answering questions and spotted creatures that we would otherwise have missed on our own.  It was well worth the investment.  Plus Jeremy was lots of fun. ,10

12461,"The tour guide was unable to speak Spanish and I (and the rest of my group) didn't understand the information that was given, as in every sentence the guide introduced words in Brazilian Portuguese which made difficult to keep up with the tour. This was the main reason to leave the tour during the pause and therefore not leaving any tip at all.",0
39887,Great friendly people very informative,10
39598,The beer was delicious and Will did a great job.,10
31851,"The tour guide Jason was amazing. He went above and beyond providing such good service. He was likable, had excellent English, and pointed out so many creatures that we would never have seen. Beyond all this Jason was incredibly knowledgeable about the culture and the creatures. He had us all in awe of the creatures and their unique characteristics. ",10
31746,WOlfgang was brilliant...couldn't fault his presentation. I was frustrated because your max grip size should have been 35 was somehow 50 people.  It was too large and I would  prefer a smaller group.,6

39713,"Loved the tour, loved the samples and loved the whole experience.",10
41358,"It’s a great tour and the guides were entertaining. However, the tour information online needs to be clearer. I paid $5.00 per person online to reserve a spot on the tour only to find it’s a free walking tour if you just show up. Not that concerned over $20 but not sure why this information isn’t clearly posted on the website. ",10
41431,Very educational. Our guide was very personable ,10
31954,"Steven and Jan (apologize if I misspelled) both know so much about the plants and animals we saw. We learned a lot, and the kids had fun too.",10
31898, great tour! Our guide was very fun and knowledgeable. The facility was extremely nice. I would live to go back again. I would recommend this tour to anyone. ,10

31868,"Informative, great tour guide, fun tasting. Unique experience ",9
59150,"It brought back some of the old days that I could remember. I lived at Missouri and Pestalozzi as a child and my father worked for Anhueser Busch. As kids in the neighborhood we would all go down to the brewer and watch the training of the Clydesdales. We would relish the Clydesdales pulling the beer wagon down Missouri Avenue so we could all watch those beautiful horses. Sometimes the driver would stop so we could just stand there and watch them.  The brewery isn't as open as it was in the old days but I enjoyed just the feeling of being there. It helped me remember my father as he was also. As an old comic used to quip, Thanks for the memories.",10

59211,"The tour guide was amazing. Very informative, friendly and it made the tour great. We’ve had issues with the hotel all weekend long but this tour easily made up for it. I am sure to return",10
39714,We felt like the tour was very disorganized. I understand the tour is free but we paid for the Bud Light tour and I felt like our experience was not great. Every time we got to a stop we waited for about 10 minutes until the next group finished. What was disappointing was while we waited our tour guides did not try and entertain/talk about the next stop. It was just an awakard 10 minutes to wait for the next tour to leave. Our tour guides also didn’t seem interested in communicating some fun facts with us. Over all beautiful campus and would come back but didn’t enjoy the tour. ,8
40646,Awesome time!! I thought the event was very planned out! The food and music was great!!,10
41427,Informative tour and good tasters.,9

67329,This is a rare opportunity to see how olive oil is made in a real factory. Lia gave a fantastic tour. It was the highlight of our trip.,10
31782,"Lucy was a great guide for the Terezin Concentration Camp tour. Due to the sensitive nature of the tour, it was depressing but Lucy kept it real and was effective in imparting her knowledge. It is evident that she has passion in what she does. ",9
59214,Our tour guide was fantastic and kept us engaged with the tour. We really enjoyed seeing all the different parts of the process and getting to taste at the different stops.,10
59152,I did 6 tours this week. Your tour was awesome because it started with the grain truck and ended with the finished product. The guide answered all my questions and we had a small group. Your store also had all your products available. Loved the whole experience. ,10

39715,Meeting Jimmy Russell,8
32068,"Arturo was an incredibly knowledgeable and thoughtful guide. One of the folks in our party was ill, and he managed to slow the pace for him while keeping the whole group engaged. I learned so much about the flora, fauna, and archaeology of Monkey Mountain. Plus, it was absolutely gorgeous. Gracias, Arturo!",10
32082,"Jarrod's passion really shined during our tour yesterday. He gave a good amount of flare and comedy while also presenting the facts clearly and concisely. I had no idea that Anchor Steam was so revolutionary, and enjoying the tap room after really was the cherry on top! ",10
32004,Our guide Allen was excellent and provided with a very informative and interesting tour of the mistico Arenal bridges hike,10
32034,El guía era bueno sin embargo su acento me resultaba difícil de entender en ocasiones además no se presentó y en momentos daba demasiada información muy rápido. Es buen guía pero tiene áreas de oportunidad,8
32036,"Aris was a very great tour guide! We’ve joined many free walking tours on our Europe trip in the past month and Aris has been the best so far! Very enthusiastic, genuine, knowledgeable and we liked the fact that he spoke a bit faster so that we got all the information ",10
32101,"Loads of samples - big tick!  Great timing, starting first thing in the morning when the market was quiet, and good group size. Personal relationships with vendors meant we got the star treatment Celia was really personable friendly and knowledgeable, and we loved every moment! ",10
73259,"Great tour, friendly staff, awesome whiskey!",10

32097,"The kayak trip ranks as pretty good, but Yan made it into a great day.  He's responsible, but easygoing.  Incredibly personable and very enjoyable, interesting individual.  He patiently listened to each of my questions in my faulty español, answered them all and gently corrected my language errors.  And he knows a lot about the flora/fauna and local culture.  A great guide. ",10
32105,I like it.,10
13351,The guide was Brazilian. He was supposed to lead a tour in Spanish and he is definitely not capable of it. We could not completely understand what he was saying. In part because of the language he was using (half Portuguese half mix of Italian-Spanish) but in part because he was absolutely chaotic. No sense or connection in his explanations. No structure at all. We left in the second stop. We would not recommend it at all. ,0
15135,Demasiada información no tan necesaria,6
14129,"El guía le puso muchísimas ganas, pero no se le entendía bien el castellano",5

45252,"Brianne our host was well prepared, knowlegable and enthusiastic. We saw both stallions and new foals. This is the season for foals",10
67405,Poor overall customer service. The standard fell poorly under expectations and Priscilla’s blasé attitude towards our comments/feedback were indicative of an organization who’s interest is merely financial and not client satisfaction. ,6
32222,"Snow was a superb guide. Very knowledgeable, friendly and patient. The sights were great and the trip was well timed.",10
32124,"nice and funny guide, good food, it was a good first Tour :)",7
27523,"Very interesting tour! It was my second tour with Good Prague Tours, because I am on Erasmus and when I have visitors from home, I cannot tell them all the history and tales like you guys do! Also, I had two similar, but yet different tours (different things were said), which I appreciate. Thumbs up!",9

32195,"Eli assisted via chat and was helpful. Omar was great in the bar/lunch area. Our host, D, was great. Rum was perfect!",10
15293,"It depends on the tour guide I guess. Libor (16-July) needs to really improve. It was a really bad tour. He's very amateur. He needs to know the following: (1) make a cohesive story line - he goes off-topic too much. (2) improve presentation skills (3) when stopping on a certain place, make sure that the story is related to that place - he tells something totally unrelated to a place and then moves on (4) acknowledge everyone in the group, and (5) think of better jokes to lighten the mood. he has awful jokes. I suggest that he goes to the other free walking tours around europe to learn (i.e. Sandeman's in Prague)",1
32193,"I'm not sure what the point of the 4 hour ride was, it just added an extra 1 hour loop without anything particularly interesting. The 3 hour ride would have been much better I think.",7

32199,The guide was good - charasmatic and charming. But the tour itself was slightly limited. Thought I would learn more. ,5

39971,"A very nice tour lead by Heather.  The one hour tour includes a short  bus ride, viewing of the yeast tubs, fermentation tanks and the column distiller, as well as some tasting.  It's obvious the staff love their job and impart their loyalty on the guests.   ",10
39724,"Well organized, learned a lot and our guide, Lindsey(sp?) was fantastic! ",10

I thought the sampling atmosphere was distant, felt like a conference. The guide was good though. The samples were pathetic, barely a taste and the four didn’t total a full small shot.

32526,"- privatized a catamaran on your website that has been replaced by a power one with noisy engines - contact person to be called in the morning of the cruise was wrong (Bruno instead of jean michel) with of course the wrong cell phone number - boat was 40 minute late in the morning at grand baie due to a catering issue (?) - when we came on board, skipper mentioned that he was not sure to reach îlot Gabriel because of the smaller size of the catamaran given by you  - food / beverage / service on board was good - team (jean michel and his crue) was professional and very nice to us ",5
39619,The facility is very well maintained.  You also have a sense that employees really like the company and they do a great job. The sampling is a really nice benefit.  ,10

32391,The tour itself was grand though could be less people. But there was a lack of information in the rollowup email 3 days prior to the tour. For example what time you were picking us up. Had to ring and leave messages,9
32667,"We had Tina showing us around and she was brilliant. I can't stress that enough. However I  was disappointed that we weren't shown any of the distillery or the rum making process at all. (When asked why I discovered that it wasn't even at the same location). The tour included a room with some awards and posters, and a 15min promotional video. The tasting was good and like Tina we had no fault there. Otherwise it wouldn't even rate a 2 out of 10.",2
39620,"I learned so much and I love beer, as do most of, if not all of my friends. Tour guide was hilarious and informative and I’m sorry that I can’t remember her name.",10

59228,We will definitely come back for another tour,10
32595,"Andy , our tour guide, is a total kick in the ass ( that’s good). Great information with wonderful humor and connection with her audience.

41375,"Our tour guide Dave was wonderful and hilarious. We learned a lot and it was a fun atmosphere. We did not expect all of the free beer we got, but it was amazing!",10
32728,I through the tour guide lacked knowledge maybe she was new to the brewery.,8
32751,"Our guide was great and very knowledgeable. We arrived an hour early and hung out next door they even let us sample a beer each there while we waited. Lots of great history, absolutely worth the money!",10

32362,We had a wonderful trip with Nepal Eco. Everyone from your team from the drivers to the guides were wonderful. The only note I would send is that the quality of the food and accommodations at Jungle World Resort didn't quite match what we had in Kathmandu or in the mountains. The guides were wonderful though. Just something to think of for your future packages! We hope to come back to Nepal very soon. Thank you again. ,9

32812,"Our tour with Costa Rica Jade tours was very professional yet personalized and welcoming. Jason , our guide was extensively knowledgeable on all varieties of animals and was able to spot and show us upclose through his viewing scope every animal we wanted to see , including sloths and monkeys.  I would highly recommend Jason along with Jade tours. ",10
32832,"We had an excellent time. This is a great way to learn the basics of Samba for non-dancer all the way through. The transfer to the club also meant that you didn't have to wait in a very long line at Rio Scenarium. Patrick our instructor was fantastic! Very friendly and took care of us all night! If you come to Rio this is a must, it'll make your Saturday nights that much more special. Thank you Patrick and Rio Dancer!",10
41336,"A great tour, that is well organised, with entertaining and informative guides. You have a great product range, and this is a good way to experience everything Mount Gay,. The bar and food menu make this more than just a simple tasting trip. The gift shop meant we were able to take Mount Gay away with us!",10
14946,"Our guide was not good.  I have been on many free tours in cities around the world.   I expected a chronological story about the history of Vienna.  He gave no history of Vienna/Austria and spoke randomly about things, jumping from century to century and not tying anything together.  We were so disappointed that we left at the break.",3

41337,I thought it was a bit expensive.  We were a group of 5 and with the extra fees we paid $147.  Other brewery tour that we have taken were $10-$15.,7

32983,"We made 2 tours , the Castle tour and The old town tour. It was very interesting and funny, and Lucy was a very nice guide",9

67324,"Amazing place, people and horses! Totally unique experience for any horse lover! ",10
15234,"It was scattered.. more like letting us know about the history of famous personalities and not more into story telling about vienna, which actually makes the tour more interesting, that's what we learned from our past free walking tour experiences. The duration it seems was long, such that it required a break in between, which made the tour more annoying..",5
32949,Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and did a great job,10

33009,Arturo was an excellent guide! He was knowledgeable about local flora and fauna as well as cultural traditions and stories.

Chhatra promptly answered all my questions before the trip making organising the trek easy.  Our guide, Keshab, and my porter, Dilip were both excellent and went beyond the call of duty to ensure things went smoothly for us during the trek, always looking out for our safety and well being.    When one of our group fell ill at the highest and most remote part of the trip, Keshab went out of his way to arrange the helicopter return.  I would definitely recommend this company.",10
33152,"We had such a wonderful time! We did not realize every bottle of Absolut was distilled and bottled at this one location. Fabulous tour guide, excellent drinks, and a memorable experience. We're lifelong Absolut fans after this visit :)",9
128591,"Tour was good, but much shorter than expected. Tour guide was great, but could not hear her at times. Facility was immaculate, all of the staff encountered were very friendly and helpful. Only negative was after eating lunch in the Tap Room, one of our party had major stomach and intestinal issues after consuming the Napa Burger. ",7
33153,"Great time! Beautiful distillery, and wonderfully thought out tour. One suggestion - it would have been neat to meet one of the distillers and have a deeper session around the chemical process of distilling vodka. I would pay a premium price for such an exclusive experience. Keep up the great work!",10
33108,We thought we’d get to see the distillery in operation or the production area. The rest of the tour was really good though.,7

239570,My daughter loved it.,10
33120,"Make cars like the 1996 Accords, which had more head room (especially in the rear seat), fewer gadgets to break down, the better double wishbone suspension, as good or better gas mileage than today's cars, a heavy duty transmission, and an affordable pricetag.  That is why this vintage of Accord is the most stolen car in American.  It's not today's Accords; it's the mid-1990's Accords!  As one tatooed owner who pulled up next to me at a stoplight yelled out, ""Man, these babies run forever, don't they?""",8

39742,Paid tours are worth every penny.,10
33178,"While I do love all of your beers, I was a bit disappointed with the tour. Having experienced other craft beer tours, I must say, the Brooklyn brewery tour is more a tour of the current ""taps"" than it is of the brewery itself. Visitors only get to see a bit of the process behind making awesome beer, and a small part of the installations are shown. I wish we would have been introduced more to the process -and not so much into the current beers of the bar-.  Nevertheless, we did enjoy our beautiful glass souvenir, as well as the tour tastings.",5
67414,Celia has a warm welcoming personality. Engaged with everyone and listened. Very knowledgeable and informative.  A good variety of the food and drink selected at the market. A great experience all round. Loved the day. ,10

33257,Great people! Could follow a Manta Ray with a guide!,10
33242,"We learned a lot about whiskey that day and it was explained in a way that makes sense for the average person who doesn’t have clue what to buy at the liquor store. The best part was the tasting, because the way each sip was described. Josh, our guide, described each ingredient that would appear sip after sip.  It made you appreciate the product!  Thanks again!   Pedro",10
33281,Awesome day !,10
16415,"We have been in yeaterday afternoon free tour.  Our guide was Rainer and he started the tour with an offensive comment. First he asked who was a Spanish speaker just to continue his speech explaining that everybody should give a tip for his work, right afterward he explained that you have been compelled to cancel the tour in Spanish. We think was quite annoying the line of thinking...   Maybe after that we weren't in the right mood but we haven't enjoyed the tour, the second part was mainly an explanation about Austria economy and taxes and that kind of things when we should have been visiting spots of the city.   Very disappointing experience, and sorry to say it's the firsts time that happen to us ( and we often use the free tours companies) ",3
33349,"Love the employees and the spot. Tour is short and sweet, love how the tasting was set up! Made for a great Christmas present as well. ",10

The upper part of the hike was athletic and exciting with many vistas along the way of both the Sayulita side and all of Bahia de Banderas— literally all of it— incredible!  Would do it again in a heartbeat.  ",10

59241,"My family went on the Beer Museum tour on 2:00 pm Sunday, July 1st.  Liz was our tour guide.  She was great! Very Knowledgeable.  Would recommend taking",9
33414,"Host seemed like he didn't want to be there and gave the impression that he didn't need to do a full presentation because we were part of a large group. He skipped parts of the presentation (no idea what I was supposed to pair the cherries with) and ultimately just directed us to the signs on the wall. In the end, I felt it was not at all worth the price. ",5
33424,Great tour and great time at the brewery !,10
33435,The staff are informative and you got 4 beers for the entry price which was good value.,10

33590,We loved our tour in Prague with Aris! We first did the free walking tour of Prague in which Aris was very informative and had great energy. The next day we did Kutná Hora tour and it was just as amazing. We recommended some friends right after our tour because everyone should be able to enjoy this wonderful tour of Prague. ,10
33623,Our booking got lost even though we got an booking confirmation. We got another tour booked about an hour later. They said that that tour would be exactly the same but the one we got was shorter. We went out about one hour later and got back about one hour earlier. ,2

71154,Tour guide was awesome and so was the scenery ,10
16980,"I took the tour in spanish however it turned out to be more a portuguese tour than a spanish tour. I really appreciated the fact that Ailton, the spanish guide, made the effort to make the tour in spanish however it was still quite hard to follow what he said, because his strong portuguese accent and because he mixed the spanish words with portuguese words. I believe you should offer a spanish tour with someone with better spanish kills to make sure that the information is transmitted correctly to all the tourists.",5

33601,Excellent service,10
33649,Vaclav was very friendly - we ended up spending the whole day with him - doing 2 tours in the 1 day - felt like we had got to grips with Prague afterwards.,8

18187,This is the second time I come to viena and this time I didn't hear too much about the history and emperors. The guide must improve his skills in Spanish.,6
33692,I really enjoyed the trip it was relaxed and not a time crunch affair. Our Guied was social-able and respectful. He took great lengths to avoid the crowds and explain things.  ,10

33747,"Excellent experience all around.  Excellent rum, host, and food,  I highly recommend!",10
5800,Schwer erkennbar zu Beginn aber sehr freundlich und informativ gewesen,9
16212,The guide was very monotone. He had some interesting points but he basically just told you what the building was not the story behind it. He also pulled one hell of a guilt trip about how long he studied to be a tour guide and how that should be reflected in the tip.. all whilst standing in the full sun whilst he was under his umbrella. Uncomfortable at best. ,3
33773,Very good and also reliable,8
113579,"Our guide, Stirling, was a wonderful tour guide. He was enthusiastic, down to earth and very knowledgeable about the history. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great experience. ",10

33738,it was great. eugene knows everything and is great company. ,10
124134,Our group of 24 visited the Jonabell Farm on a sunny day at the end of April.  We had an excellent tour guide and got to visit the mares and the stallions at our own pace and view the beauty of the farm.  Everyone was driving around on the trolley and all our questions were answered.  It was important to know how well the horses are cared for when they are working and when they retire!  I would definitely go back again!,10
33878,"the van picking us up was a 15 seat van. we were the second hotel pickup location. there were 3 or 4 more hotel pickups after ours. this took 45 minutes to pick everyone up. very boring and unpleasant. the van was full. we were fortunate enough to get window seats. had we not, the drive would have been very unsatisfactory. the guide had very basic information about the tour and what we were seeing. not great enrichment of our experience, no insight or deeper thought.",4

33863,The tour guide was very informative. It’s nice to have someone give you a tour who loves what he does ,10
16210,He told us exactly what money to leave at the end. He didn't speak to the crowd he spoke very quietly. Didn't wait for us to reach the crowd to speak. Didn't enjoy very much.,3
59247,Very informative and fun. Beer was great too! Loved being able to taste different beer types beyond what I normally drink.,10
16423,Guide was boring. Didn't engage audience much.,3
33810,Super interesting! Perfect amount of detail and unique variation of beers to try. ,10
34019,Mainly for two reasons - 1. You did not take us to the river waterfall (our friends who has taken the cruise with other companies had taken them to watch the waterfall on the same day) 2. Unlimited drinks  preferably juices were not available 3. Snorkeling place was not good (strong waves were present at the location),5
39762, Clydesdales were awesome to look at .,9
33955,Wonderful hike with Steve - so informative and helpful! (Also left a review on trip advisor). ,10

16635,"Good places, but more structured information needed. More dates and backgrounds information of people that are spoken about. ",5
34018,Very good ,10
33956,Driver was there when we got to him. He was very friendly. Got us here safe and sound. Almost wish we were using him tomorrow to get to the airport instead of the free hotel shuttle service. They keep changing our departure times!,10
42824,"Third time on the tour. Since some of the operations are moving to the other facility, there isn’t as much to see, and it’s more chaotic is the ‘common rooms’ of the tour (where people are hanging out). ",6

45464,American Pharoah! ,10
62985,"My friend and I saw 5 horse farms in two days. We even got to see Calumet, which we were told is rare.  Our absolute favorite was WInstar. We loved getting to meet the handsome stallions, beginning with a very special introduction to Pioneer of the Nile, who everyone in the group got to pet.   I have ridden all my life. I have a beautiful black OTTB Kris S offspring who raced at Belmont and Aquaduct for three years. I have worked with this horse for 15 years, but I did not know much about breeding and races. My friend and I learned so much on this tour.  We decided that while the entire KY horse farm area is gorgeous, the most strikingly beautiful and well managed farm we saw is Winstar.   Thank you for your warm hospitality and amazing tour.  Frances McKay",10

17138,"rude guide. he told us in the beginning of the tour that a tour like this normally costs aroun 30-35 euros and that we should tip him 30% of that which would be 10euros. he also acted like he was a better guide than other guides of free tours. all the others were students who ""studied one evening about the city"" while he had to do a whole year course or something. so he disrespected other ""younger"" guides. like they dont know what they are doing. it was my least favourite tour of the 6 tours i did during my trip last week.  really dissappointed about his disrespect regarding younger guides .  ",0
34053,It was a really informative tour that was interesting and fun. ,10
34037,Positive first: I think Patrick did a very good Job   That said I think that the room you chose is not good and it would have been lovely to know the size of the group beforehand.  In the presentation the place looked more like a professional dancing school or room. When we came into the breakfast room of the mercure hotel (!) we were a little bit shocked. Furthermore there was a group of around 10 giggling girls and only one other man and our two men turned right around and we were near to cancel the course.  I think it's all about expectations. If you prepare people to what they get they can decide better instead of being disappointed. A more mixed group or knowing beforehand what you have to expect would have been much better. And a better lighting and more ambient then that breakfast room would have been even better.  Still we had fun so i did not write the review on tripadvisor... Thank you and best regards Jule,6

19787,"40 min de explicación antes de comenzar la visita propiamente dicha fue excesiva, y más cuando el guía hablaba una mezcla de español, portugués e italiano...no se le entendía",1
18400,El dominio del español del guía no era suficiente y sus explicaciones daban saltos cronológicos lo cual dificultaba seguir la historia. Aunque he de decir que el guía era muy simpático,2
34108,Our guide Kamil was very knowledgeable and entertaining. It's the perfect way to get an overview of the city and then decide on the places where you want to spend more time exploring the history.,10

34220,Our tour guide Rommel was very knowledgable and was really funny. The tour was well organised and the bar was lovely. I’m usually a gin man but I’m also now a rum convert! Thank you for a fun day getting a little sweet on rum,10

34151,From the beginning of the booking of the trip to the actual trip was very well organized. We felt like we were traveling with and old friend thanks to our guide. For a young man he was very knowledgeable and we felt very safe and taken care of.  I would book another excursion with you in a minute. ,10
34162,"Enjoyed the trek thoroughly. However, it would have been nice to get a description of what the day trail entails vs sunset trail (two different paths apparently with day being through a ranch and a dense foliage canopy) for the customer to make an informed decision. Other than that it was a good experience and a great guide!",8
34210,"Our guide Steve was fantastic. Friendly, informative and patient. Perfect adventure all around. Thank you!",10
34159,We had a wonderful time on our ATV/Snorkeling tour with Carlos.,10
34164,The tour was conducted by a very fun and knowledgable person. 90 minutes was a good amount of time. The large variety of beer tastings at the end was a nice bonus. The $25 cost was a really good value.,10
23515,There were too many people on the tour and it was really difficult to hear and the guide made a few jokes which were inappropriate. The whole thing was a bit incoherent as he kept taking on the identity of the historic characters and it was difficult to tell when he was talking about himself or the historical characters. He did seem to have a good historical knowledge. ,2

33394,"A great introduction to Guayaquil history and culture. Our guide, Eduardo, was informative and fun.",10
34260,"It is a great overview of the history of Mount Gay and the products on the market. The guide Tina was super awesome with a wicked sense of humour. My only criticism is I never got to see stills, fermentation tanks, ageing warehouses...etc.... the whole production set up. This is coming from a rum geek! Maybe next time I can arrange a tour",10
17669,"Our guide was a good one because he knew everything about Wien, but he had difficulties to catch our attention, probably because We were a really big group. ",6
17385,We booked a tour online for the next day at 10am. We showed up at 10 the next day and they told us we could not join because we were too late. What is the point of booking a tour if you then can't go just because other people showed up before? ,0
34271,The ride was fun and exciting.  Our guide was terrific and very friendly.  Thank you for the great ride.  We all enjoyed the experience.,10

34362,Best tour ever!!!,10
17567,"Very factual  No funny or interesting anecdotes (which is what I enjoy the most about these kinds of tours). The tour also lacked spontaneity and energy. There were way too many people on the tour (approx 50 on mine) so the company should have provided more guides.  In saying that, it did still provide a reasonable overview of Vienna and visited all the key sites ",4

34414,Our tour guide Jarred was really knowledgeable and made it fun for all. ,10
34472,"I had higher expectations, expecting to see more exhibits, more robotics, and maybe a movie.  If you take the Nissan plant tour in Smyrna, TN you see clips of Nissan commercials from around the world, a short movie about the history and then have the plant tour.  It was good to see the various products that Honda makes.     Also, there is no word on when Honda tours will be available.  ",7
34379,Our tour guide Tina I think her name was did a wonderful job of not only telling the story of mount gay but also a lot of info about the story of Barbados. She was one of the best tour guides we’ve had period. ,10

It was so informative and it really felt like he was so happy to be there with us- not like he was forced to be there and giving tours was a part of his job that he didn't really love(: the welcome drinks were great and the opportunity to try the spirits was great as well, I feel like we got so much for the 15 bucks we paid to do the tour. Afterwards, the bar tending staff was so friendly and outgoing and we enjoyed a couple of drinks. We will 100% be back and will be asking for Bluecoat wherever we go. Thank you for a great Sunday!

I felt like the afternoon was a waste of time and would have rather gone back to Grand Bay just because the beach we ended up going to for lunch was one close to our house that we go to enough already.

34812,Great teacher,10
18188,"The tour was nothing as described. Titled ""Hitler's Vienna"" we assumed it would be based around things specifically relating to him and his youth. Instead we were treated to over half an hour about different art and architecture styles which doesn't interest me at all- it's why I did NOT choose an art history tour. Nothing the guide told us was new information, it was all things we'd been able to read ourselves on Wikipedia or remembered from school days! The tour guide talked incessantly and definitely knew what she was talking about, however the tour needs to change its name and description, as it both didn't cover most of the topics advertised on your website and instead focused on an entirely different topic area! All in all, we felt it was a massive waste of both our time and money as we weren't shown anything we couldn't have seen ourselves and I'm sure others agreed as plenty of people decided to leave the tour early.

18197,"The guid was very Good and told us a lot of interesting things, but it was more like a school class. But if he makes Some jokes it is more fun.   The information about the history of the city was more interesting than the information about the present. That's because the topics of the present were not that interesting for students in my opinion. He talked for example about how much the rent is for an apartment and about the industry but I wasn't very interessed in it. I wish he told us more about the schoolsystem in the austia for example.",6

The island and cove are so beautiful and we loved the short hike to the top of a cliff with great views of the ocean and we enjoyed a quick glimpse of some humpback whales in the bay.  On the ride back to Sayulita we took a short unplanned tour of San Francisco, which is a sweet little town. Highly recommend this group - they are very thoughtful and knowledgeable about the PV area and take you off the beaten path of the typical guided tour groups.",10

59262,"Jessi was a great tour guide for our Beermaster Tour on July 3rd. She was funny, entertaining, and very informative. She made the tour fun, and I honestly learned quite a lot about what all goes into making a Budweiser. It was such a great time that I'm now sharing the word with all of my friends, and trying to plan a return trip to do it again! Thank you to all of the awesome staff involved for a great experience!",10

34894,I am disappointed that i do not have any pictures because i was afraid to take a phone or camera. Other tours offer a photos taken by the the guide. This would enhance your tour. Also a bathroom facility close to the waters entry point would be another big plus for women. Otherwise the guide was really great and the mangroves were awesome.,7

34903,"Well, I wouldn´t call it tour brewery... but rather special tasting in the tap room brewery... yes, I know that is not too much too see in a beer factory, but ""the tour"" was really small. But I recomend friends to go there because the history told was nice, beer tasting was nice and the end in the tap room was really funny. Keep the good work!",8
34957,Yan was monkey mountain sunset tour guide. He was the best.   This is an epic coastal mountain hike - and I have done many across the globe. Must do. ,10

35060,A,10
19728,"I found the explanations given by the guide inexact and irrelevant. In addition, it was difficult to me to understand the guide (a brasilian guy) because he didn't speak Spanish but a mixture of Spanish, Portuguese and Italian... The group was too big. In my opinion the guide should select only the 35 people with a reservation (as we were said at the begining by the staff) but he didn't do so and all the people (there were more than 10 people without reservation) could follow the tour.",2
59255,"Nice people, friendly, and helpful. Was riding through and the tour was one of my stops. Heavy rain and thunderstorms when I arrived on my motorcycle. The clerk checked with her manager and they allowed me to leave my backpack behind the counter during my tour so my clothes would stay dry. And I appreciated that.",10

2504,The tour was very informative. I liked the fact we got to tour the whole distillery. The drink was an added bonus. It was delicious! The tasting was fun. I also enjoyed just sitting and having a drink at for bar. Very nice place. Do you guys do private events? ,10
2604,"I like the lay out of the new place, way better than the old space. Walking through the cocktail lounge felt great and then in to the production room is so impressive with the to huge copper pot stills. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and easy to ask question to which I had plenty.  And the tasting was well done. I guess the only down side was that there was no whisky / Tough Broad to taste.",10
35233,We really enjoyed this tour. Celia was very informative and interesting and she took us to all sorts of places that we wouldn't have noticed or found without her. The food was so delicious and unusual too. There was no pressure to buy.  She also pointed out other landmarks and shops in Portobello Road. A great way to spend a morning in London. ,10

35138,Great story. Great beer. Bring back the Brekin Brown!,9
35200,There was nothing imaginative nor creative about that facility. With the massive changes that are coming and automobiles including self driving cars I would’ve hoped to receive some insight on Hondas future and plans for it. Instead you had the robot that you’ve had on display for many years.  Just a brief video would have been all it would’ve taken to provide insight.,2
35215,"The transportation was clean and comfortable, Francisco (our guide) was enthusiastic and great at spotting wildlife, and the fresh fruit and juice was a refreshing way to end our tour.",10
35173,Great tour! Great bartender! Loved the gift shop.  Excited about future of distillery when distributes barrels of own bourbon.  ,8
2598,The distillery was not up and running yet;  the room was quite chilly.,7
30047,"The drinks were amazing. However, the event itself was a let-down. There was not enough to keep the night interesting for a full 4 hours. It felt like it should have been an hour-long cocktail hour at most. Also, if you are going to host a Repeal-Day Event,  a little research goes a long way. If you encourage era-attire, your staff should set the example and not be in cliche, outdated flapper dresses. Bartenders and drinks were a 10, everything else about the event planning was a 1. ",3
35181,"The tour started pretty close to on-time with about 25 people. Our guide, Rose, was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The spirits in the tasting were also great.",10
59268,It was very informative and just an overall interesting place. Bubba was a great guide. ,10
63057,Bubba was the best guide!,10
35242,I thought the instructor was great.  I loved the progression that he taught.  The only bit of feedback is that I paid for a private lesson and there was an additional person in our class.  I know there was a price difference and I wasn't offered a refund for that portion that I overpaid. ,10
35307,Just an awesome experiance,10
19326,"I booked it online in advance. When I told the lady( who seems to arrange the guides) about it, she rudely informed me that it doesn't matter, just stay there and you will be given the number. If it is so, why should I take the trouble to book it in advance. She was very rude and the start of the whole tour begun with a bad note. We happened to be in the tour of a lovely lady Eva. She was good, energetic but she lacked the natural charm of a tour guide. She was screaming at the top of her lungs and speaking without pause. Very unpleasant and difficult for a listner to follow. Her information had so many boring details that the audience almost lost their interest after concentrating for 1-2 minutes. I have taken free tours in many countries but the one in Vienna didn't fulfill my lowest expectation. I would recommend to work on your social skills and natural communication rather than being mechanical. Free Walking tour is an experience and at the end of the tour you bond not only with the tour guide but also with the fellow group members. Thank you!",1
35291,We came for a bachelorette party and everyone had such a fun time! The instructor was great and it was fun tasting all the different beers! Thank again for a great experience !,10

59272,"Too Hot, black algae detract.  ",6
35581,Both the servers and the tour guide seems like they were in a big hurry and didn't really care about interacting with us. Very different from a wine tasting where servers are really into the wine and Vineyards and will answer questions. I repeatedly said that they were going too fast. I was still on my 3rd tasting when they were pouring the six one. But they didn't really seem to care about that.  ,0
35584,Great tour guide👍👍👍,10

35577,Loved seeing all the equipment and trying the various samples.  The tour guide was unable to answer some of my more detailed technical questions but that was probably more me being a typical homebrewer fanboy!  ,9

We were given a short tour of empty machinery. We were told nothing had been working for 3 days. If I knew this were the case I would not have booked tickets. I am ultimately disappointed in Anchor and would like a refund. Thank you",0

39822,"It was was well organised, and the young guide did a great job explaining things all the way through the process from start to finish.  We had lunch in the restaurant the service was extremely good, and the staff very pleasant and attentive, and the food was excellent.  One thing I was disappointed in, when I visited many years ago I remember there was a fun part of the visit where there was a projection onto the floor where the floor looked like water, then froze, and the Famouse  Grouse bird from the TV advert walked across the floor 😀",9
31162,"The End of Prohibition event I went to said there would be cocktails and hors'deurves, however the only food available was chicken on a stick, shrimp, and oysters. We went after work, and didn't eat beforehand, assuming we would be eating at the event. However my friends and I don't eat meat, so after two drinks we were so hungry, drunk, and miserable, we left to go to Frankford Hall. And we were not alone, while in the elevator I heard 5 other guests complaining about how hungry they were; one man said that he found a baby carrot in his pocket that he ate in desperation (he said it was slightly salty). I love your cocktails, and I don't know if this was a ploy to have people drink less at the open bar, but I will be very very weary about ever going another event that promises food at Philadelphia Distilling. If you serve alcohol you have to serve carbs.   Additionally, we were looking forward to the advertised distillery tours, but those did not seem to be happening.",6

19891,"The atmosphere between group and guide was tensed from the begining when the guide pressured the group to tip at least 15€ in the end because ""that's what such a tour used to cost per hour.""  The tour as such wasn't up to the standards of other free walking tours either. It wasn't interactive at all, only once did we  get the chance to ask our guide  Questions. You could tell the guide knew a lot about Vienna - but she was pretty bad in communicating it in a interesting way. The Information about each sight was given in a boring way without much Humor, reference to personal insights about life in Vienna or interesting tips for visitors of the City. Someone who read a lot about the history of Vienna and has GPS could probably have given the Same tour without ever stepping foot im Vienna before.  Finally, as expected, the tipping at the end of the tour was highly uncomfortable. The pressure made by the guide in the begining wasn't relativized at all and she colltected the money worldless, taking notice how much each participant tipped.",1
35789,It was fascinating! Our guide was knowledgeable and funny and answered all our questions. We learned so much - and the gins and liqueurs were so tasty!,10
35795,Excellent tour. Distillation process well explained.,10

Our Jade Tour of Manuel Antonio National Park was the highlight of our trip. We got to see sloths, lizards, beautiful insects, frogs, birds, monkeys, and much more. Francisco was very knowledgeable about various trees and the animals which made the experience even more meaningful. With his magnifying scope we were able to not only see more animals but also got great pictures and videos. If we had not done a tour, I highly doubt we would have been able to see any of the animals or bugs we got to see! Absolutely amazing experience!",9

35843,Sal was a fantastic host/docent. We had a wonderful time!!,10

39829,Great guides!,10
21609,"Well, I signed up online but eventually I was told that the number of people reached the maximum and so I couldn't join officially with the free leaflet given.",5
23086,Guide was nice and tried hard but voice didn't project so hard to hear and struggled a bit with the language ,6
26687,"Our guide, Rose, had great product knowledge. ",10
35939,"The tour guide was kind of insufferable. To sum up, what we would've wanted is more St. George, less [insert tour guide's name here]. When he stuck more closely to the science + history and dropped the irritating, self-aggrandizing and unfunny shtick, it was interesting. He seemed to feel the need to hold us hostage to his ego along the way. On the other hand, the bartender for our tasting (Rose?) was totally awesome, the facilities gorgeous, and the spirits delicious.",6
35936,"Person who hosted my tasting, Janine, did a great job.  Extremely knowledgeable.",10
35965,Excellent  guided tour,10
38678,Presentation was informative and interesting. Tina is a star for you ; make certain you keep her!,10
20469,Tour guide did not offer the detail / history I would have liked ,3
21272,I found I didnt get the history of Vienna.  Some of the places we went didnt feel like they were meant to be on a walking tour.  Also found I wasn't able to engage with guide unfortunately.  ,4
240618,"Clean, friendly, beautiful grounds! Thought gift shop was pricey..",10
59280,It was a great atmosphere. The staff for beer school at 3pm were fantastic and the whole building and food area were phenomenal places to escape the heat and enjoy some down time. ,10
29426,"we had a great time, Put us in the christmas spirit. Wish we would have visited years ago",10
36062,"Tasting was interesting, despite the small portions and the “no I can’t give you a bit more” policy. The “tour” itself was very disappointing. The manager spoke way too fast for someone talking with foreigners. ",7
36060,Very friendly nice discovery. Great beer ever !,10
36024,Tour guide is well versed in the entire process.  Entire tour was informative and the guide made it entertaining as well. Would have liked the opportunity to take photos by the large logo on the outside of the production building.,10

36083,"The tour was just great! The guide, Jon was very knowledgeable about beer and about anchor brewery. He was a great guide and very friendly. The brewery is nice, clean, and the tour just long enough. The tasting session was a great way to finish it all off. I had an amazing time! Thanks, Jon!  The only improvement I can think of is to allow people to mix and match beers into a six pack in the gift shop. After the tasting session, a lot of people want to buy a sampler of beer but that’s difficult if you have to buy 6 of each.",10
67467,Nathan was a great guide ,10
36084,excellent service! ,10

128532,The culinary tour with Lisa was lovely! We spent the whole afternoon together and were happy to have so many stops along the way to taste different examples of Cajun cuisine. Would absolutely go back for other tours as we did not schedule enough time to see Avery Island itself. Thanks Lisa! ,10
36094,Great tour and fabulous tour guide not to mention fantastic rum!  What a lovely setting to enjoy our cocktails after the tour.,10
22969,The group we were in was very large and it was sometimes hard to hear the leader of the tour. I would have also liked to hear more historical information about Vienna throughout the tour. ,5
36104,"Tour was interesting, little annoyed no prior communication about a private event and last orders being 6:40, leaving us enough time for one whole beer.",6
36102,"I was actually going to email and say how wonderful our trip was!! Arturro was so wonderful. Easy, comfortable and I learned so much. This was the highlight of our trip . Thank you so much ",10
36088,This was one of my favorite memories in Costa Rica! Carlos is an amazing guide on our mountain atv beach tour. I will defintely use Pininos adventures again when back in Tamarindo!,10
36175,Tour guide was very good seen a lot of animals well worth the money ,10
20673,"I liked the tour, but I'd hoped for more explanations and history. ",5

36126,Great beer. Great people.,10
36093,"We rented a bike only for 5 days. Didn't take a tour but the boys at AXR the best. Painless to work with, great little CRF 230. Ripped all over the area. Thanks Diego.. Dennis Zach Ronnie",10
43144,Great tour guides. Knowledgeable. Informative. And of course the beer. So many varieties we were unaware of. All superb. Rich history. Delicious beer. Friendly people who keep on pouring. What’s not to love? Thank you.  Kelly C.  San Francisco,10

36124,Amazing tour with talented Rumal. Plus we all chipped in for a bottle of 1703!!! 🥃,10
20674,"I have a feeling the tour guide knew much more than he shared with us. He seemed uncomfortable with the ""I am Franz Josef"" method--maybe the tour would be better without this pretend element. I was also surprised by what he did not mention. For example, we walked by the Graben, and he never mentioned that Vienna used to have city walls. We also could have gone down the Graben and talked about the monument and how the plague impacted the city. There are so many important parts of Vienna's history that were never mentioned. Coming away from the tour, I know very little more about the city than I did before. This is a shame. Vienna is a wonderful place (I personally believe it is the most beautiful city in the world), but this tour did not do it justice. ",1
36118,"We loved the tour. For the life of me I can’t remember the guys name, he’s obsessed with Star Wars and dinosaurs :) He was just so good, really interesting, lots of good facts and funny stories and the time just flew by.

36292,Beautiful place and the tour guide was very interesting. You might think about placing a lower proof sample in your samples.  ,10
36176,"My dad and me had an outstanding experience when we visited the Wild Turkey Distilling Co. The tour was informative and entertaining.

36252,The driver was right on time - 5 minutes early actually! It was a beautiful vehicle and the driver offered us cold bottles of water as soon as we got in. I think our driver’s name was Mauricio- he was excellent!! Not like the crazy drivers in Tamarindo! The tour was FANTASTIC- I have reviewed on Tripadvisor under Horseback Ride to Nauyaca Falls- it was 10 out of 10 - if I could give the day 15 out of 10 I would!!!,10

36264,The tasting at the end was incredibly rushed. Took some of the fun out of things. Should be spread out more rather than having a 15 minute chug-a-thon. No time to appreciate nuances in the beers.,7
36261,Great tour. Lots of friendly employees. Great whiskey!,10
36268,Very pleasant tour with a very lively and high energy tour guide. ,9
36320,"Roy was a great guide, very informative and helpful with taking photos. The trip was very easy to book and offered the option of no transport or snacks, as we had our own transport and were p,anting on staying in the park.",10

23679,"We were at the tour at exactly 10 am. I had made a reservation ten days in advance. Getting to the meeting point we got lost in the streets. It is our first day and time in VIenna. When we got there the lady who was incharge of the Spanish tour spoke to us very Rudely and loudly saying we can't join anymore Bc English tour had left. I have seen half the world at this point and never have I found a free walking tour to be so unaccomadting. Usually they let people join and there are no reservations before hand for a free tour. I did my part, you can check under filza salim; however, you have no right to speak to people rudely. I usually tip my tours atleast $30. You missed out on a good tip as well",0
36453,"We had a brilliant tour! It was well organised, really interesting and funny too! The beers were all lovely and the tour is such a bargain price for what you get! Thank you so much :) ",10
36394,"We had an image of Wild Turkey as a cheap whiskey good for college kids.  Boy were we wrong!  The bourbon is outstanding and we also had the privilege of meeting and talking with Mr. Jimmie and Eddie Russell, your master distillers.  Beautiful view from your tasting room.  Would be fantastic in the other seasons.",10
36436,"We loved seeing all the vehicle, even our lawn mower was there.  Since we’re 70 years old, it brought make many fond memories.  The history of it all was something we had never put together.  So thank you for letting us come and enjoy it all.    It was beautiful, clean, well organized and informational!",10

124047,"The guides, Kirby and Lana, were so informative and so professional, polite and nice!  And who wouldn't enjoy being in the presence of those great, majestic horses?  Everything was perfect, including the weather...couldn't ask for a better day.  The icing on the cake was seeing the baby Clydesdale that was just born to Jessica, the very morning of our tour...she was just 8-1/2 hours old when we went through...so sweet. The grounds are beautiful, the stables are immaculate and the beer was cold and the horses were very accommodating - we got to have pictures with Stan and he was a true gentleman.  Great experience!",10
36532,We joined a city and favela tour. So we were able to see the most important things with excellent guides. It was a great expierence. ,10
26082,"Have done many free tours before which were excellent but found the guide this time had lots of information to give but we felt that as though he was very knowledgeable it came across as though he was reading from a book.  His information was fact, fact, fact we found our attention wandering. Rainer would tell us all about a palace we had walked through but then ignore a beautiful fountain we had walked past. No humour in the walk.",4
21408,Tour war mit fast 3 Stunden einfach zu lang. Einzelne Stopps dauerten zu lange mit zu vielen teilweise zusammenhanglosen Anekdoten zu lange. Ansonsten war die Führung gut und informativ.,5
124043,Very enjoyable and interesting tour that explained the inner workings of the ranch.,10
62962,"I was very excited to know the brewery because Brooklyn beers are my favorite in the world. I loved to know more about the factory and the history, also I loved to try four types during the visit and bring back the awesome glass! Stay there and enjoy more beers in the bar was a great time for me and my friends. A dream became true! (yes, adults dream with this!!!)",10
68924,"Process was very easy and efficient, and the guide was good, timely and spent extra time with us beyond what was promised. ",6
31247,Tour guide went too fast.  Didn't let us admire the buildings from the outside nor did he talk about any of the buildings.,8

36554,Itinerary was good but too much people in the class the day we attended.it could be because it was carnival weekend.but we had fun.,8
21491,Tour guide was too quiet to hear at times which made him very hard to follow. Maybe a microphone would be good.,4
63058,"What a fun event! There was something for everyone! We were celebrating my 4 year old daughter's birthday. She wanted to see Canaan Smith for her birthday that was Wednesday and just happened to be a nearby show close to her birthday. She was looking forward to seeing the Clydesdales as well and she and my 12yo loved seeing them! She also enjoyed the playground. My 12 yo loved the virtual reality and the brewery tour. I loved the friendly atmosphere, food trucks, free bites, and of course the live music. I have been following Canaan for 6 years, so that was my favorite part! All of the staff were so friendly. Thanks for a great day!",10

36544,"The guys that went with us on our very large group were amazing, attentive and kind. I had a little trouble at one point being able to control my ATV and got a little nervous but one of our guides made sure to stay with me all the rest of the way up the hill. I felt like a grandma but they were super supportive and just great! Thanks to all of you for a great afternoon! I can't wait to come back to Costa Rica! ",10
36590,"awesome products, fun location!",10

36718,"Edwina was our tour guide, and she was marvelous. She was a wealth of information and having booked the 11:00 AM tour, on a Monday, it was the perfect time and day to do it.

36742,"Tour guide was good, rum was great",10
67371,"The headsets weren’t working...many of us mentioned it , guide was a fun guy but wrote off that we couldn’t hear him, so it was a waste.  Have been to Jack Janiels  distillery in Tennessee, Alexander  Keith’s  in Nova Scotia and Heineken in Holland.  My husband drinks Steam Whistle and thought he’d enjoy this, but was disappointed ",3
36750,This is the second time I have done the small batch tour and thoroughly enjoyed it!,9

36724,Tour guide was awesome,10
36821,Juan picked us up from our house spot on time. He was very friendly and courteous. He was very knowledgable and helpful in taking photos. we saw lots of creatures including a Pygmy Owl and Red Eyed Tree Frog. I’ve no idea how he found them. Lovely meal at Rainmaker.,10

36816,The trip was a great experience. Very well organized.,7
63026,"Would have been nice to provide directions for people who came grin our of town to knife where to park. At the intersection of where to park there were signs pointing both directions,  but the police would make the people in far pain to the north cross traffic and go to the south.  Luckily no one got hit.  The sighs should have been farther back before the intersection so you knew what lane to be in. Canaan was great.  Would have been nice to be able to taste test the different types of beer. This could have been done with a wristband with tear off tabs so that each person is only allowed do many tastes.",8
71139,"Super friendly and knowledgeable staff. I always enjoy coming to SN as the family seems to being doing it all, just right!",10

36820,Great tour. Very friendly welcome,10
36851,"Nothing but a movie and a tasting.  I expected to see you in action: fermenting, distilling, barrels aging.  The tour guide was funny, but I learned very very little about distilling.",0
21818,The tour is too long and too detailed.  Too much standing around.  Be better to keep walking and give a far more concise orientation tour rather than a degree lecture.  Also smaller groups.,1
62986,"I literally deducted 2 points. 1 pt because one of the food vendors had a political agenda that was plastered on the exterior of their truck and the 2nd pt was because there was no Bud Light available. Being a Budweiser event,  I kind of understand the lack of Bud Light but the other was likely not something that could have been known by the event planners. Everything else was top notch and I really wanted to give a 10. King of Beers,  always and forever. ",8

21914,Average. Not too funny,5
54942,Jason was fantastic and we learned so much. Thank you!,10

38641,"Our tour guide was phenomenal, personable and knowledgeable. We loved her! The new visitor's center is gorgeous. As Lawrenceburg residents, it was a wonderful to bring our out of state visitors here for some background on something so uniquely Kentucky!",10
22030,Felt there was no depth to tour. No mention of the deep and rich art history. No tour of the museum area. Spent a long time talking bait coffee and where to. Buy it and not much else. ,1

55141,Driver very friendly.  Easy to talk to.  Took good care of us.,10
36829,"Dropped off at wrong hotel, picked up late the following morning and booked the wrong restaurant for our last lunch ",10
22278,I attended a free walking on Sept 14th.(in English). The route was chaotic and didnt cover main touristic objects (not talking about ALL the objects but major should be included!). The guide (Eva if I am not mistaken) had a strong accent and it was difficult to understand her sometimes.,5
55148,"The tour guide was excellent, she was very informative and pleasant. Loved seeing all the fouls.",10
55217,The tour was very informational with several tastings along the way.  Very much enjoyed lunch at the Biergarten also!  ,6

22365,"En primer lugar, estaba mal el horario que confirmaron. En la página web decís que el tour en español era a las 10am. Hicimos la reserva y nos llego el mail de confirmación pero cuando llegamos nos dijeron que había un error en la web y que era a las 14 hs.  Llegamos a las 14 hs y nos dio el tour un brasilero que no sabía hablar bien español y varias cosas no se entendían. ",2
22371,The lady was exceptionally rude ,1
37619,"We had a wonderful time! The tour was private, very personal and Carlos was an awesome tour guide. This was an excellent experience, and I recommended to other people immediately afterward.",10

37699,Jason and Juan both incredibly knowledgable. Received two meals and one snack with the three tours we did and all three were excellent thanks. Just the right amount of information was provided. Everyone was patiently catered for. Juan ( twice our guide) had endless patience and is incredibly sensitive and knowledgeable. Muchas gracias!,10

37785,"It was very unsettling to be rushed by barking, growling dogs. Ownership should be sensitive to how clientele might react to such a welcoming. The rum was tasty and the tour guide and rum bottler were friendly.",5
124130,The tour was very informative and well run.  The staff was knowledgeable and did an excellent job of presenting information. ,10

37787,Great tour with very knowledgable guide. Loved the history lesson at the beginning. Loved the tasting at the end.,10
37846,Jeremias was an excellent guide. He found so many obscure animals. He was really good with the kids. The drink and snack at the end of the tour was a really nice touch.  Overall it was very well organized. ,10

37794,Excellent guides,10
37868,I am probably one of Borough Markets nearest neighbours. Having lived in the area for almost thirty years. Celia's tour was so good and informative that I felt I was visiting it for the first time. The tastings were amazing. I will definitely be supporting my local market even more.,10
37864,Celia shared her knowledge and skills with passion taking care to relate to each individual.  We had been to the market before and eaten in the restaurants but Celia gave us a new perspective allowing us to understand the artisans and their foods.  We spent a week in the West End - a cultural and food experience of which Celia was a magnificent highlight.  ,10
37838,Tour was fun and interesting. Good value for money ,10
37841,Excellent!,10
37870,It was a unique experience and we liked Jason our guide .,10
37908,Our guide andres was great. Great experience overall. Thanks ,10
26794,I can't really blame the tour nor the guide. I just think that the tour wasn't interesting enough.  I did many tours around Europe and that was the first one I got really bored.,6
37981,Amy was fantastic very informative and included everyone in there the tour. We will be back on a day when the guys are in. Loved turret too x ,10
54834,Everyone at the farm was so friendly and the farm itself was absolutely gorgeous!,10
37659,Super fun. Fantastic photos taken. Everyone involved made every effort to make sure we had a good time. ,10
55045,The ability to see beautiful animals and learn about the industry ,10
54808,"I like Taylor Made Farm, and Taylor Made Farm likes me. Simple as that!",10
30787,Everyone was so helpful on our trip to the Brewery. Being from St. Louis and loving Anhueser Busch products makes you feel that much better when you visit this place. The whole staff made our visit one of a kind ,10
37894,"Good tour guide, good tour, good beer",10
37913,Interesting and funny tour with beer tasting,10
37940,Bubba made our experience terrific. ,10
37888,"Bubba gave a great tour.  However, your distillery is too much ""factory"" and not enough traditional ""distillery.""  Maker's Mark was much closer to what we were looking for.",5
37892,i like the way i was treated,10
38672,Great tour and great tour guide. ,10
37927,I was very interested in Anchor since I’m from New Jersey and have been drinking several varieties of beer from Anchor for a long time. Jarred the guide was excellent and  fun to tour with. ,10
38007,Group size exceeded 8 as we were told when we booked. The beginning was poorly organized with us waiting 30-40 minutes to be assigned to a group. Every sighting took too long as 13 people had to look through the scope. The tour guide was good but had to manage too many people. We should have been split into 2 groups.....very disappointed!!!,3
37971,We loved our Manuel Antonio National Park tour! Our guide Roy was knowledgeable and fun and made sure we saw as much wildlife as possible. We’ll be back! ,10
37907,We really enjoyed it and definitely will be back!  Tour was awesome. ,10
37944,"Guides (Kathrin) English was very bad, often lost for words  and the tour was not informative (only: ""I recommend doing xx or xx"" and ""this is also a nice place""). All other free walking tours I have ever done have been much better ",2
37982,Very friendly and informative. The tasters were lovely too and the drama to take home for the driver a great idea.,9
37926,Our good was great! I told him where we had gone before so he took us on a different route. We rode on the beach and through river beds. Awesome time!,10
55003,Peg & Frosted,10
37954,It was extremely interesting,8
22854,The appt was excellently located but not particularly well stocked with kitchen utensils/equipment. The curtains hardly covered the windows and the exterior condition of the place was quite shabby. the staircase to the unit was tough to negotiate with heavy bags.,5
24077,"Because we did not like the tour. The main problem was not that it was hard to understand the guide's accent, the main problem was that the information was all mixed up, when the guide started telling us about something interesting then it was not concluded. By the end of the tour we were left with the feeling of not having learned anything about this tour. Unfortunately, we feel that we wasted our time. ",2
23818,"I sent some emails before the tour to ask a question and got not answer. Moreover, the guide did not spoke Spanish. It was a mixture of Italian and Portuguese difficult to understand",1
39866,"It was not worth the money. Parking was horrible. Samples were very small and we weren’t even offered Wild Turkey, which we have never tried and were hoping to since that is where we were. Additionally we were disappointed in the bulk process and general uncleanliness of the area.",0
23369,"We requested the tour in spanish. We left after 20 minutes. The guide didn't speak good spanish, he mixed up roman empire with the austro-hungarian empire and we didn't think he attracted the attention of the group. We have done many tours around Europe and would'nt reccomend good Vienna Tours",9
38050,"Totalmente satisfecho. Puntualidad, bu3n servicio. Alex, el coordinador, explica todo y brinda toda información y comparte sus conocimientos con toda dedicación a cada pasajero. Muy conforme con el paseo. Totalmente recomendable",10
55122,"Amazing products, friendly staff. Thank you!",10
38023,Bubba - our tour guide - was AWESOME!!!!  Very interesting and educational tour.  We had a blast.,10
38181,Bubba was great as a tour guide.  Love the product.,10
38147,Tour guide needs headset or microphone ,8
38160,Bubba was great.  The story telling blended in with the history and description of the bourbon making process made this tour outstanding.,10
38183,"Walked in the door of the gift shop, and Mr. Russell and his wife were just sitting there.   It was a treat getting to talk to both of them for a few minutes.  Thank you.",9
38015,Beautiful facility and Bubba gave us a great tour!  ,10
38067,Some of the staff were rude and the food is weird and it's to busy ,5
38008,"Jeremy was a great guide - personable, knowledgeable and fun!!   He spotted so many birds and animals that we never would have seen without him.  He even found two hummingbirds in a nest and helped us get photos and videos of them.  Thanks Jeremy for a really fun day at Rainmaker!!",10
38027,"I’m bad with names, but the tour guide was awesome. She was really authentic and excited to give us the tour. She was also very knowledge but didn’t pass that information in a boring presentation at Everyone employee we interacted with was super welcoming. Then lastly the overall aesthetic was put together nicely and we enjoyed it. Whiskey was great! The Still Lemonade was one of our favorites. Drinks seems a little expensive but unlike many places we actually got a stronger drink for the same price as other places make it was worth the price especially having craft whiskey. Definitely gained new customers! ",10
23741,No dominaba demasiado el español,6
124143,"Our tour guide, Dan, was great. Fresh samples were also great. ",10
38176,"Excellent tour guide, beautiful distillery, great bourbon!",10
38202,Our tour guide bubba made the entire tour.  Great experience ,10
38069,Tour and tastings were a perfect start to our night (anniversary celebration). Lisa was a great guide. Look forward to coming back and hoping to plan some corporate events at the Distillery. ,10
38125,Great tour with one of the founders was a wonderful experience. Seeing the thought and care that has gone into creating a craft distillery and quality product so close to home makes us hopeful for this future landmark. So many new things seem to be more about the flash and less about the product.  ,10
38127,"the location, primarily and the odd people walking in and out of the brewery next door ",0
23429,"Taking the tour wasn't worth it. The tour guide talked perfect english, which is cool, but talked for 15 minutes everytime we stopped, so we couldn't walked that much throughout the city.",4
38159,I had such a fun time! Annie and Sam were fantastic. Such a great time learning about how the spirits are made and tasting too!,10
124103,Lesley is an excellent instructor and I was given a private lesson.,10
37848,We loved the cocktail tour! We didn’t realize that the tour was only of the bottling plant and that we wouldn’t get to see anything on the regular tour. So if we had spent $100 on a taxi to get there and back to see nothing we would have been greatly disappointed. At least booking the cocktail tour we had lots of samples and lots of fun in the cocktail competiton!,10
38254,"Maitiú was a wonderful tour guide.  Extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and adaptable.  Could not have asked for a better guide.  ",9
204920,The food was delicious and the stock ale was fantastic.,10

38363,"Great atmosphere, service, and of course beer. Very informative stories and tour as well.",10
38368,New feedback!,9
38170,Horrible services answering phones and getting back to me.  Absolutely horrible services ,1
38252,Very friendly and happy staff who made us feel really welcome !!!,10
38313,It was great. Thank you! ,10
38320,"Bubba was awesome- best tour we have ever had, the lady in gift shop was nice and helpful. the prices on merchandise was normal instead of over priced like some of the other distilleries we visited.",10
38323,"Jamie was knowledgeable, funny, and friendly!",10
141297,,10
24267,The tour was very narrative  We were standing all the time It was actually a standing tour rather than a walking tour We left before the tour ended,0
23676,"Because it was a poor tour, almost not history of the city and the buildings, not curiosities. The guide was ver y nice nut i think he has to tell us more historical facts.",4
38336,Really interesting. Great guide and excellent help wit tasting.,10
38371,Enjoyed the drink sampling in the end!,9
158,"Amazing tour!!  Loved the tour guide, funny guy and very knowledgeable! Will definitely be back! ",10
183,The VIP tour was excellent.  Both guides were very knowledgeable and entertaining.  The gifts at the end of the tour were great.  The other people in my party loved the tour.,10
202,"There is no reason... my finger hit the 9, not the 10... chubby fingers...:)",9
24042,Porque el guía no se expresaba correctamente y no hablaba español.,3
24345,Informative but very dry and boring tour. Liven it up a bit. Bring more humor and interesting stories. Look to freetours Budapest as an example. That was the best walking tour I've done ever!,3
23945,The guide moved too fast from one point to another not allowing time to catch up with the tour or photograph the city sites,5
23944,"It was good to have a tour but, there was too much emphasis on buying other tours. Also the group was too large to hear everything. But I'm grateful and appreciative to have had a tour of these places, I wanted not to be negative but to give you constructive points to help you develop. Thank you so much for the tour. Kathrine was really lovely ",4
23958,"The tour was advertised as being capped at 30, and the group was roughly 50. We did not stay- so I'm not rating the tour, just clarifying why I would not recommend to a friend. ",0
24269,"The guide had a lot of enthusiasm, but his spanish was not 100% understandable all the time so it was hard to follow up. We have taken tours in several cities and this was the first one where we had to google and search things afterwards that were not clear. ",6
24137,We waited at the meetingpoint but no one showed up.. ,0
24341,"Porque el chico no tenía ni idea... Y no nos explicó gran cosa de Viena mucha historia mucho dato superfluo pero poca chicha y encima hemos descubierto que no son guías profesionales, sino aficionados que cobráis en negro",1
24674,Guide Not so enthusiastic about doing the tour.,6
24562,I would & have recommended the free tour. But I don't feel the music tour was good value for money. The tour was OK. The guide lovely & seemed quite passionate. But the description did that sold me on the tour did not meet the actual so I would not recommend the music tour specifically. ,6
25068,it was a very nice tour but I experienced tours where we saw in the same time more things and it was a little bit more with humour and funny,6
25972,"Unser Guide war Barbara +: Gutes Wissen  Konnte die Fragen beantworten Man hat die wichtigsten Locations gesehen Hat viele Tipps gegeben Begeistert von der Stadt.  - : Fast nur Ideen für Museen (nichts für Leute, die nicht so daran interessiert sind) Keine richtigen Insider Tipps Sehr distanziert Zum Teil gesprochen, ohne dass alle sie hören konnten (hinter ihr waren noch Leute der Gruppe) ",6
24572,"The guide, Lada, was the least enthusiastic guide we could have had. I think that once a guide likes what he is doing, you can really see it and feel it. This way, he doesn't have to go on and on about the tips that he expects to receive, but just gives his best out of his enthusiasm and believe me that the tips would come. After a few minutes that we did our best to enjoy and learn from the guide, we felt that there is no reason for us to suffer on our vacation and just left the group. Amd good that we did, since the same night we found a really good guide. ",0
24802,"Shame!!!! You didn’t let us come on the tour. You have been disrespectful and racist. And it’s called free tour based on tuo, you can’t ask me 8€. Shame!!!",0
24664,Top large Group Voice of guide was not loud enough,4
25711,There were so many iconic sights that didn't make the tour at all. I'm glad we still had a full day after the tour to see everything else. ,6
25245,C,3

25853,"The group was too big and sometimes I could hardly understand the tour guide. (His English wasn‘t that bad but it could definitely be better!!) However, the duration of the tour was accurat and I got some nice information. Thank you!",5
25861,"Our tour guide Caroline was good but our group was terrible. Very disruptive and far too large. I think that there should be more tour guides and the groups should be split up more. Also, more historical information would be nice, I felt that in comparison to other tours we have done there was less content. ",5
28671,We arrived at 10:03 am. We were late and couldnt join. That was not a problem but they were not friendly at all. ,0
26961,"It was fine, but the group was to large and we could not hear everything",5
27788,Based on other tours average.,5
26796,Guide was not enthusiastic or exciting and spoke very quietly.,4
27191,"There seemed to be many unrelated information that our tour guide told us. He was very well informed and smart. But I didn't seem to find it as interesting as I thought I would. In every city I am,  I attend a free tour. But I was a bit disappointed.",6
27287,Guide was knowledgeable but wasn't interesting at all. She didn't manage to keep anyone's attention. ,1
612,"Matt was AWESOME!! Well done, best your guide ive ever had ",10
27245,The Group was bigger than normal.  The guide was knowledgeable and helpful but quite too passive with not good enough English and not engaging. ,6
27689,0,6
28561,Tour guide was very difficult to understand. He spoke quietly so difficult to follow the tour lots. ,4
29231,"Iva was excellent and informative but there was so much more to see that could easily have been included e.g. the Rathaus, Parliament building, university, holocaust memorial etc. If the Hofburg is shown from the other side it is far more impressive and you get a much better idea of the size of the palace.",6
28959,Guide didn't turn up!,0
195,Great product,10
37922,Catherine as very quiet The tour was slow The information was not explained fully Would of preferred a more traditional coffee place for a stop ,0
29145,"For me there was a little too much promotion of other places/businesses - like, I felt like at least a fourth or a third of the tour was descriptions of restaurants, museums, and other attractions. Maybe some of the others find it helpful, but personally I check TripAdvisor or Google a place before I go, and there everything that was mentioned can be found within the first 20-30 tips I'm sure. If it had been less obvious things, like ""off the beaten path"", I would have been more interested (though I also get that sometimes the most obvious choices are simply the most seeable things in the city). Recommendations are fine, they just could be made a lot briefer and less detailed to make space for more information about the city. I still enjoyed the tour though - thank you for the service that you provide!",6
31658,"Guide was very kind and informative, but the tour was overlong",5
36728,IT was quite short but time consuming. ,6
30723,"Was not an engaged tour guide, did not care about ensuring the entire group could hear and was not thoughtful about ensuring the group was together when walking. I left early I felt like I wasn't getting anything out of it.",1
30688,"I love doing Free Tours they are usually really really good. Maybe I've been extremely lucky with my guides, but in my opinion the guide in Vienna wasn't half as engaged with the tour as the ones I've done before (which have been around 10). I know it was cold, but we were also on Holidays, and she was hurrying too much, we lost some people and she said they left. What happened is that they couldn't follow her. I am used to guides that always control the whole group and know who is missing and who is not every second. Also I've been in different cities, some more expensive than Vienna and I've never been taken to a coffee stop as expensive as the one for this tour.",5
30097,It was boring and a very very large group. I was disappointed and left after half an hour. Never happened me before. ,2
1262,Great tour guide.,10
44494,,10
45846,We really enjoyed our tour and tasting.  Tour guide was very knowledgeable and we tasted and enjoyed things we might not have tried had we not gone on this tour.  ,10
45895,It was very informative and our server was amazing! Next time we'll come back to do the tour and buy more! 😁👌🏽,10
45463,I do wish we saw the bottling process on the tour and tried the mash but I liked the tour. Loved the history of the buildings. I love the property. It’s the most beautiful property of any distillery we visited and it really sweetens the deal when Jimmy is there signing bottles! ,10
45672,We have visited the farm before and loved it but they have made it even better. Such a beautiful place such nice people.,10
45691,"the employees were very helpful and very friendly, your facilities are well organized and easy to see as you walk through.  you explain the history and the how's and when which is very interesting to me.  good job for everyone",10
45826,It is a great Horse farm & the staff was very cordial to their guests.,10
45727,A beautiful farm and great history!  Truly an honor to be where Secretariat stood and is laid to rest!  A must see and I hope to go again.,10
45806,"Beautiful visitor center & friendly staff. Our tour guide, Bubba, was the best and made all the difference with a great tour. The 'flight' tasting was a nice surprise, along with Bubba's guidance & explanations of what we were were drinking. I'm not a fan of bourbon, so I can't say if the products are any better than anyone else's. But I'd highly recommend the tour. I purchased the 'Stinger' honey liqueur and, at home, taste tested it versus the Jack Daniels honey liqueur. The Wild Turkey was definitely a more complex taste and warmer going down. I'd recommend that product to friends and will purchase it again. ",8
45698,ITCwas an unforgettable experience for the whole family!!! ,10
45581,Very informative tour without being boring. The tour guide was great. And you gave much more beer to taste than other brewery tours. ,10
45822,"Loved the different samples and how passionate your ""brewers"" are about the job they obviously love!!",10
45831,This is the 2nd time on the tour and I felt like the 1st time I received a lot more facts about the family and buildings.  it was more interesting to learn about the families and what not.,7
45868,Tour guide seemed to rush much of the tour.,8
45437,"Very informative, kind, great horses to see ",10
44023,Guide was incredible. So interesting,10
44919,Said it would be 1 hour but tour started 1 hour in. The guide asked for participation. We did participate and then were told off.,7
45752,"beautiful place, all the folks were very freindly! Edwina our tour guide was exceptional !",10
45758,"This was definitely one of my favorite tours, our guide Kevin was very knowledgeable, would recommend to anyone! ",10
45715,very friendly guide and imparted her knowledge of the Experience in  the occasional humourous manner,10
45658,The access to California Chrome and foals went far beyond our tour experience at many other farms.,10
45810,Just a great experience ,10
45745,It is quite enjoyable to visit a distillery which is run by folks who are passionate about what they do and want to share that passion with others.,10
45872,Tour guide spent over an hour and a half with us and was very thorough when discussing the history and horses of Mill Ridge.Such a joy to pet the foals and moms and even had a visit from Headley Bell himself to thank us for coming.,10
45217,We had a great time,10
45867,Great tour guide Eric !!! Cheers to ABI!! ,10
45766,Our guide Rocco did a great job. ,10
45875,The tour was very interesting and informative.  We even got to see a horse being operated on!,10
46027,"We loved our tour. Jon was great, answered all our questions. Derrick came in at end of our tour and invited us to tap room. We were not rushed through to make room for next tour like at Sam Adams. ",10
45713,Seeing Chrome great. Rest of tour so-so. We had 2 drive to 3 different locations. Perhaps a shuttle would work. Again success of tour goes back to quality and interest of guide. We went on 5 different tours. ,6
45679,Your setting is awesome and we enjoyed your distillery very much. I especially enjoyed meeting Bill Russell.,9
62910,Great experience overall. And the plant tour was a awesome bonus on top.  Please consider starting regular tours at the Columbus location. ,10
45675,Excellent experience and tour guides. Driving to each location was a little awkward. Perhaps Taylor Made could utilize their golf carts for some of the tour.   Overall an excellent experience.,9
45637,The information was pretty general and It was difficult to hear the guide without any sound system.,6
45650,"I was able to meet and have my picture taken with the Jimmy Russell! Our tour guide, Heather, was excellent...very informative and humorous. The Bourbon tasting certainly sparked my interest in Wild 🦃",10
44496,"Our tour guide, Connor, was awesome! He was funny and really knowledgeable. I would recommend this tour for anyone coming to the STL area and we will be coming back again!",10
44024,"We didn't get to see any of the horses up close. It was mostly a tour of their facilities. The facilities were beautiful, but I would have liked to actually see the stallions. ",1
45697,"The rickshaw ride was fabulous. Our family of 6 all enjoyed the experience, the scenery was beautiful and the drivers were fantastic. Would recommend to everyone. ",10
45659,"Our tour guide, Ian Tapp, was the most knowledgable and professional of all guides we experienced at Horse Country tours. He did a particularly nice job describing the breeding shed process. The grounds were beautiful.  The size of the group was a bit large-- people were not focusing on Ian and were doing dumb things, so a more intimate experience would be better.  It would be nice to be able to have more direct access to the horses.  An opportunity to purchase some Gainesway merchandise would be a plus, particularly for big Tapit fans!",8
45695,"We had a fabulous time on the tour. Our tour guide was new but was fun, knowledgeable and friendly. Sorry I have forgotten her name. We toured Wild Turkey some years ago and love your new tour center. Will certainly return. Also wonderful bonus to give veterans free tours, really nice.",10
45737,"Please excuse the voice texting and the inaccuracies secondary to that but Price was amazing yesterday and despite the weather we had the most amazing time. Obviously what you are doing there and what you are Farm represents is incredible and the horses were Majestic and friendly and a pleasure to be around. More than that, the entire experience was one we will remember for the rest of our lives and I know that we will see you one day again, next time with our daughter, I hope. I'm glad you reached out to us but we would give you the highest recommendation possible and will tell everybody that and hope to see you again one day",10
45748,It is enjoyable but we are a little bit disappointed at the fact that you can not touch the exhibits there and you can not get in the vehicles.,5
45309,"The trip was very pleasant and the guide was very nice and helpful. Thanks, Cookie!",10
45776,"Our tour guide, Bubba made our visit memorable. As a matter of fact, his personality, stories and general attitude were the best part of our Kentucky journey. The biggest take away was meeting Mr. Jimmy Russell.  ",10
45693,"We felt like there were a lot of details skipped in the tour. I thought a distillery tour would be a great way to learn about how bourbon is made, but it felt like we were expected to already know a lot beforehand. There were so many gaps in the explaination that I still couldn’t really tell you how bourbon is made or what makes Boone Bourbon different from any other. ",4
45583,Beautiful farm.  Owner showed us around which meant a lot because she gave us a true inside look at the business.  Everyone was very friendly and seemed interested in us having a good time!  Thanks!,10

240624,It would be one step better to have a non-drinker option for tour.,9
45666,Unbelievable experience! We couldn't believe that we were part of such a close and intimate part of the running of a farm. Exceeded our expectations by tenfold,10
46073,"Our tour was booked for 4:00pm we arrived a little late, the taxi driver didn't know where to go.  When we got there at 4:15pm... they closed at 3:00pm So... late or not they weren't there.  We never took the tour.  Very Disappointing!!!!",0

20722,Tour was awesome. Matt was a good time. Distillery is absolutely beautiful. I would recommend the tour and a visit to anyone. Whiskey wasn't for me. Not my particular choice for a bottle,5
46096,I made a mstake. I wanted to say 10. The tour was wonderful! I highly recomend it!,10
62993,The speakers are too loud and made it hard to hear some of information. I also thought the more Budweiser product for sale (most of the stuff sold online store IE t-shirts.) Not very many giveaways.  On a positive note the BBQ was good and the tour was very good.,6
30858,"The tour was a waste of time. I've taken free tours all around Europe and I never had a bad experience with it, but this one definitely didn't worth the time. The guide showed us spots of the city that every person (even tourists) could notice, and the historical references were way too poor. Vienna is a place with a lot of history in it, many stories are there to be told.  ",0
30755,The tour guide was rather unpleasant and repetitive. We barely took closer looks at any particular places; more often he just pointed in the direction of landmarks without explaining them. ,2
32896,Porque no existe tal tour. No hay tour en español como reservé.,0
34827,"I believe the route could be a little bit more interesting. The guide was good, but there are a lot of places more interesting that we could visit. ",6

34764,"Our guide was very enthusiastic but English was not her first language and she often struggled to communicate clearly to the group.  It wasn't like we didn't enjoy the walk and there was good energy in the group.  But, it would have been better if the guide had a better English grasp. ",5
34177,"It was -2C, there was far too much talking and not enough walking. People were leaving. I myself left after about 45mins. I'm sure it's nice in the Summer, but the tour didn't seem to have been adapted for the conditions. I've done a few walking tours in European cities, but this one was disappointing, too slow, and time for photos should be allocated.",3
34326,"Actually, I give up because it was so boring...",4
35980,The tour guide was too fast and a couple members of the group (separate parties) got lost along the way. My party met another party while searching for the tour guide. ,5
38712,The tour was excellent. Host was very nolligable,10
14455,"The tour was fast. You get less beer then you use to. The  cost of the tour went over 100% since the last time I went. At least then I got to drink a few beers. I payed $5 to drink the equivalent of 1 beer in 5 small glasses. Before I paid 1¢ and got 5 beers.  See what I mean. The food was way over priced. $14 for 6  wings.  $10 for 3  Fried  oysters. I could buy 10 fresh off the boat oysters for that place. They were so small but you  brought them out on the biggest plate on the table. It looked like you guys were either playing a joke or you thought that made your food better by trying to be fance. If that's the goal then you got to learn how to plate something. Anyway, the beer was good. The service was good. The place looks great. But you need to pump your  breaks a little bit. This is New Hampshire. Not California. And you have cocks not chefs. ",5
35510,"the guides said there wew not enough people, it seems there should be 10 at the least. well at 10h00 there were 8, and they immediately left. at 10h05 rhere were already 15 people there... all sad because they did not wait a bit. at the end we went with another group at 11h00.",0
35462,Tour was cancelled due to 8 people arriving. ,0
35519,I booked a tour for 10:00. Arrived there 5min before time. At 10:00 the guide decided to cancel the tour because we were less than 10 people. At 10:00 the guide went away! He could have waited 10 or 15min. Some more people arrived a little late... We could have had the tour but the guide was unflexible. I have to give a 0. ,0
35540,"Because it wasn’t a tour. The tourist guide was there waiting for the group, 5 minutes before that should started the tour the guide said that wasn’t the minimum quorum 10 people - at that moment we were 8- and he didn’t do it. He left. 2 minutes after 4 people more coming but the guide was crossing the street. Al there lost time. When you booked don’t say that is necessary a minimum of tourist and if not this could be cancelate. At the end all take a free tour of the other agency. We dividen in Spanish and English at 11. ",0

36019,"As with most tours, and we have done 5 over the past 2 x weeks around Europe, the success depends very heavily on the ability of the tour guide. Our guide was very knowledgeable and tried her best, but did not have a confident manner with her English, and while the group looked to be a nice, manageable 15-16 persons as we departed, a further 5-6 x persons joined at the very last minute and really, she struggled to compete with city noise and the larger group size. Hence we decided to depart the tours just over 1/2 way through. The cool temperatures also didn't help things.",6
36812,We stood still for too long listening to history rather than seeing more sights. ,5
36478,This tour was terrible. It should be called „where is the entrance to...”,0
37252,The tour itself was quite pleasant and informative. But the ladies that received us at the meeting place was quite awkward and unpleasant. ,4
25118,"It was very loud (traffic, etc) and we couldn't hear anything she had to say until the end at the tasting room.",6
37797,"The tour was too touristy in my eyes. Restaurant recommendations I can find on tripadvisor or other websides, I don't have to do a tour for that. The guide was well informed but coudn't tranform the historical knowledge in exciting stories. The present culture and what Vienna is today didn't really appear but in touristy recommendations. ",0
37865,"+ very friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgable guide  _ group was quite large, tried to sell us another tour, the cafe we stopped at was very touristic and extremely overpriced",6
38165,"It was a standing tour, not a walking tour. The program was boring, not thought well through.",2
39240,"The tour was too much axed on architecture styles rather than on history and funny ""cocasse"" stories about Vienne like I'm used to in other european city tours. There was very few interactions between the guide and the group.",4
24323,"Decent wiskey,  but not extraordinary. Your price is too high. ",5
25687,"The tour itself was great, but it was disappointing to arrive and find out the lounge was closed for a private event. The distillery is a bit off the beaten path, so to come all that way from our hotel in downtown Denver for one hour wasn't really the experience we expected. It would've been nice to have the option to reschedule so we could stay longer and have more than two tastes. ",6
24869,"Good whiskey, unique flavor & taste, just don't feel the price was inline with other whiskeys I drink on a regular basis or that it was superior to other whiskeys to warrant the extra cost.",6
36650,"The drinks and atmosphere at Philadelphia Distilling is great, it is a really cool spot.  However, the logistics and operations are a nightmare, both times that I've attended.  This time, we went on the tour, and the tour guide kept telling us about different drinks available at the bar, and encouraging us to stay after in the tasting room.  Never did anyone tell us that we should put our name in before the tour, (or that you even could do that) because upon going back downstairs, we would be forbidden to enter the bar (because you are ""not allowed to stand"").  Almost everyone on my tour just left afterward disappointed.  It was a fun night for an occasion cut way short.   There just seems to be so many rules at the distillery, perhaps to make it feel more exclusive, but it really is just limiting.  ",4
42041,"We did Rain Maker Park Day and Night Jungle Tours with Juan Campos as our Naturalist Guide.  Juan was very knowledgeable, professional, and fun! It was an added bonus that his English is so much better than my very limited Spanish skills.  The Rain Maker Park was both a great place for a day tour, it was just the right amount of endurance level and time with the beauty of the park, time to learn about the flora/fauna, the suspension bridges, and the pool to refresh at the water fall.   The night tour was also really fun - Juan was also our guide for this tour.  We loved seeing the nature at night.  With Juan's scope we were able to get great pictures.   The meal after both tours was very good and we were happy to experience the local foods. ",10
123981,It was a great experience very interesting. I had no idea how big the plant was ,10
1547,"Adam was a great tour guide.  He was very knowledgeable on the entire process, very engaging, and answered all of our questions.  Also, the beer was great!  We will absolutely recommend Green Flash to friends and family.  Thanks for the awesome tour!",10
25389,To see how the mashbarrel is opperate and the filling of a washbarrel is something we didn't see in any other distillery. The verry enthousiastic guides of the tour and the reception. How cats are part of the team regards to the healty regulation the cats are sleep near the stills.,10
36773,You’re online billing system caused me to lose $83 dollars because the promo code that I copied and pasted did not work.  I called AXR to talk to someone and they said they couldn’t do anything about it. I said I was going to book white water rafting as well and asked if we could work a sea for that instead to which the guy agreed.  When I came down for white water rafting on Sunday they had my reservation but no notes or any idea about what I was taking about. I had to remind the guy about it. Eventually he quoted me $20 Less than the total. $20 is not $80. He wouldn’t even meet me half way. I spent almost $1000 and you couldn’t take off $40.  I wrote a review the first time I was there two years ago that had 509 people read it and now I regret that. I may have to tell people on trip advisor what happened. ,4
37878,"We booked online the night before . was supposed to get a confirmation number never received an E-mail. Showed up at the booked time 8:00 am walked in and was told at first no reservation found in our name. Young man kept looking and finally found the reservation all was well.  Our tour guide was a fellow by the name of Dany took the time to make sure we understood the machine and all the rules and hand signals. Dany took us into the mountains and he was constantly scanning for wild life. We seen Macaws in their nests. The macaws and the trees they nest in our protected in Costa Rica,an albino sloth sleeping and a great explanation of their life. Down to the falls and a great story about the Indigenous people who used to live in the area. Dani pointed things out to us about the trees and great explanations. on who fed off what and why. We headed pack into Jaco and never realized that 3 hours had passed so  fast. Once again thanks Dani for a great tour and getting to know you.

Ryan at the bar was great too, and made me the most delicious rum lemonade! Thoroughly enjoyed myself, and I’d definitely recommend that others visit and do the tour!",10
44029,"The tasting lasted five minutes and the portions were so small, it looked like what pools in the bottom of a glass after you take a big drink. The guide was not personable, talked for a few minutes and touted “this is the one I keep in my freezer for guests.” I thought we were tasting high end Wild Turkey? 3/10. Would not go back. ",3
8912,"We were the first people to go on the cooking/culture tour that Yannis and his cousin had set up. They were very friendly and hospitable and it was lovely to find out about Cretan life and family. The cooking was interesting, but as we are both experienced cooks, much of what was done was familiar to us. It would have been useful to have had some printed recipes to take away. The boys need to get their timings sorted out more accurately, especially if there are more people to cater for. Yannis is very enthusiastic and full of love for his country and way of life, but many people would expect a more polished presentation. I can also see a possible problem if children go on the tour as there is not a lot to occupy them. They were talking of 10 people as a maximum number per tour, but the table in the kitchen is only small and I would think they would have a problem with more than 6. Cooking courses are a real niche market and people who go on them expect a thoroughly professional approach and while we enjoyed ourselves immensely (especially talking to all the family), we felt it was a bit amateurish and that they were ""feeling their way"" and were a bit unsure of what to do next. However, we wish them every success in their new venture and hope it goes from strength to strength. Jen Coast.  ",8
22075,"We found the world war 2 tour fantastic.,the tour guide Demetrius so knowledgeable and shared the emotional intensity with us very sensitively. He took us everywhere we wanted to go places we could never find on our own. What added to the experience was meeting his lovely family. We would recommend the tour to everyone. Thank you an experience we will never forget and will hold dear to our hearts ",10
12982,"The guide - Alex - was amazing. 10/10. Informative, helpful, kind. The gorge itself was beautiful and a once-in-a-ifetime-experience. But the bus driver on the way back was very unprofessional, kept stopping to talk to people. We just wanted to get home",8

",10
21398,"Great experience all in all. We enjoyed a lot to hear about the story of the company, about the techniques that bring the whisky alive, about curious and anecdotal facts. And of course it is very interesting to actually see from the ground malted barley to the distilled spirit flowing into the barrels and experience the manufacturing steps with all the senses. ",10
21693,Michael was exceptional in his description of the how the distillation process works.,10

27394,Had a great experience learning about the distillery and how the whisky is made. Well worth paying for the famous tasting experience. ,10
32632,The tour was very good. Our experience was a little less than a 10 because we had a 'bad' group.  They were a bit disruptive and rather distracting (children) and others repeatedly not staying with the group were a bit problematic for the guide. Otherwise it was very good.  ,9
32841,"Because I had to respond to a number of market research questions BEFORE I could complete the online booking of a distillery tour.  When I raised this in my initial comments, the response was apologetic but still ""it's necessary for the Brand Team"".    If you feel it is a necessity for prospective paying customers to also be forced to provide marketing input for you, it just reminds me that Famous Grouse is just a big business juggernaut and a brand to be avoided.

We had an incredible evening preparing delicious Cretan food, wine tasting, learning about Cretan history and getting to know Yiannis and his family. All this in literally the most picture-perfect setting you can image (it felt like I was in a movie set). I can't speak highly enough of this experience - we came as strangers and left as friends :) ",10

22585,"I thought the wine tour we went on was great. The history of Crete was well described by the driver. It's clear that him and his dad love showing off their beautiful island and truly like to entertain guests.  The only thing I would improve, is the wine tasting itself. The wines were all beautiful, but I would have liked a little more walk through while doing the tasting. For example, pour the wine for all and then prompt the group for smells and then tastes, etc... That way everyone is on the same tasting step at the same time. I understand it may be hard for larger groups, but I wanted to give the feedback.  Again, we really enjoyed the tour, but we have done the above with other tours and it helped the group bond and added to the tasting experience overall.",10

Also, my wife asked if there was a nursing room and the clerk rudely told her to use the bathroom, because everyone loves to eat where other people poop. It would’ve been better if he simply said “No, we don’t have a nursing area.”",3

I was also able to try two of the burbons I have never had before and loved them both. They will be on my future buy list. Then finally, I bought myself the Master's Keep Decades and it was signed by one of the Master Distillers, Eddie. It was a fantastic experience and I am glad we made the trip to see it. (Side note: my favorite burbon is Wild Turkey, but my favorite wiskey is Jameson. I learned that Jameson uses Wild Turkey's old barrels, which explains why I like Jameson so much.)

44031,Nice people ! Whiskeys were solid. Tasting was ok. Perhaps include a drink menu while tasting ,8
41651,Guides were well informed and very personable and we liked the stops. However it would have been helpful to know we were going to Rum Point as I don’t really see that as a private beach as the website described. We have some friends coming down next month and I will definitely pass along your information. Their last name is Masloff and they will be here the week after Easter.,10
55044,"Everything was beautiful and the guides were great.  I was disappointed that we didn't get to see more of the workings of the farm, like how they train the horses and the practice track.  The horses and grounds are beautiful and enjoyed that.",5
54909,"Knowledgeable, friendly staff. Great facility, great horses, great scenery.  Great all around showcase of the best of what Central KY has to offer in terms of natural beauty and our thoroughbred industry. ",10
55200,The tour was very interesting and the staff was very friendly. Definitely worth the trip.,10
55219,"Our guide obviously loves the horses, was very knowledgeable and took good care of us as we encountered a storm during the rolling part of the tour! We are so excited for Winstar on Justify's Triple Crown accomplish!",10
10908,"The tour was very informative without being boring.  I had no idea the amount of effort it takes to make good bourbon, whiskey, vodka and gin. I will enjoy the good stuff even more. I really enjoyed your quality products.  Wish I could have flown some back to Minnesota with me.  I'll start asking my local liquor warehouse to try to get their distributor to inquire about your products and maybe some day it will be available here as well.  In the mean time keep up the good work.",10
43704,"Great team, great atmosphere, really engaging talk around the history of the brewery and amazing beers! Well worth the visit. ",10
40904,Our tour guide was amazing and very knowledgeable. He explained the process in a way we could understand and was able to answer all of our questions! ,10
31829,"When I saw the promotion for the pre-opening, I guess I expected something more. When we went, there was one nice lady, a nice gentleman, and a couple of workers in the back. Had I not known where the place was already, it would have been hard to find; no signs or street address markers. The small sample setup had a kettle of spiced cider, and we were offered a sample, but I had to ask to try the syrup and didn't get the feeling that the rum itself was available for a tasting. I asked about they types of rum to be made and was shown ""this one, and then this one"" (literally pointing at boxed bottles) with no explanation of what was different or special about either. I took one step to the right back of the sample table to get a view of the space and a (construction?) worker pretty rudely said ""you can't come past that barrel"" (No signs, flagging, warning, etc.). All in all, we spent about 10 minutes in the place, sampled the spiced cider and learned practically nothing about Richland Rum. I know that this all sounds critical, and I know that this was a pre-opening effort, but you need to know what our experience was like to make it better for the future. I'm really excited that we're going to have a distillery n Brunswick, but you've got to make the experience much more friendly and appealing if you're going to make a go of it.",5
39901,The tour guides were knowledgeable and we enjoyed seeing the production line. ,9
38567,Our tour guide was awesome and made it very fun and informative ,10

35334,The tour was nice everything was clean the tour wasn't extremely long the tasting was good. There was no pressure to buy the product after the tour ,10
43705,"The whole reason why we rated this tour a 10 was because of the tour guide!  Although we cannot remember her name (she was the tour guide 4/4 at 2pm) we have not forgotten how spectacular is was at her job - fun, funny, knowledgeable, etc.  Well done!",10
42001,"Fascinating history of Anchor Steam Brewery, explanation of beer brewing techniques and generous half hour tasting by the knowledgeable and friendly Jon and Jarred. So glad we made it and all the Anchor beers are delicious! ",10
42187,Tour guide was great! ,10
42019,The guy that led our tour was amazing and funny. It was great learning the history and process of anchor steam beer and trying all the beer was amazing. I found some favorites and even took a 6 pack home with me of the special ones you cant find at the market very easy. ,10
43620,The tour was fine but to be honest it did not exceed my expectations. In addition I didn't like the fact that we could not take photos during the tour.,6
55178,"I absolutely loved meeting the foals and hearing the history of the farm, and our guide (I'm so sorry I forget her name) was wonderful...you could just feel the sincerity in everything she said.  Thank you for a wonderful experience!",10
55265,Great guide and a fun ride,10
17306,"Impressed by the tour.  It was a little long and very detailed. Some of the folks in my group would have gone for a lighter version and more anecdotes around the founding of the company.  The science of distillery is fascinating to many, but I think your stronger suit is your unique story of getting to where you are today.  We've been to some other distillers and enjoyed their tours because they tell their particular story.    Wonderful gin and being a scotch fan. the peat and smoke was also appreciated.  As you grow, don't fully let go of your roots.  Keep up the good work.",8
55066,"We had a guest visiting from South Africa and took him on the California Chrome tour.  He thoroughly enjoyed it ... as did we!  Even though we've lived in the area for quite a while, we'd never toured Taylor Made.  We will definitely bring other guests in the future.  ",10
38434,"Great guide, cool spot, and the Golden Ale was delicious!",10
4008,We had a reservation.  We showed up. And there were 38 people to go along.  It was impossible to hear the guide if you were not up front.  These yours should be limited to 15 people. Then people would pay appropriately for a good tour.  We left the group as it set off from the Albertina ,0
4842,"We barely saw any of the main sights. I know on other free walking tours I've done, we see stuff that tourists aren't as likely to see, but it's still mixed about half and half. Also, when we stopped somewhere it was almost like a history lesson, rather than talking about what it actually is. We ended up googling things about the sites. It was just very bad. ",0
12817,This was horrible. Disorganized waste of valuable time I would like a refund or I am going to slam it trip advisor. The guide gave both English and German an hour to walk around after the tour and the tour started late. Total rip off and the guide was awful. There was no skip the line either. We waited to get the tickets waited to get into the palace. Judy a terrible waste of time shame on you ,0
9846,"As I told the booking employee, the tour lasted only 1h35min and that includes the travel time from the meeting location to the palace not 2h30 min as you advertise. I would like a refund for this tour. Honestly, I feel like I cheated. I went on a walking Hitler tour, which was wonderful and was as advertised. ",0
20682,"Dir deutsche Tour war leider nicht sehr gut. Die 2,5h waren sehr langwierig. Der Einstieg für eine free guided Tour war sehr unpassend und Das Konzept nicht gut erklärt. A la ""Free heißt nicht umsonst und 1h Führung in Wien kostet 15€"" da hab ich keine Lust etwas zu geben.  Die Infos an der Albertina und in der Hofburg waren interessant. Der Stopp in der Hofburg allerdings viel zu lang. Die Info über Papst Benedikt an der Kirche am Hof waren ganz fehl am Platz, wir wollten etwas über Wien erfahren . Inhaltlich war leider kein roter Faden erkennbar und die Infos zum Teil sogar wiederholend... Der Guide war auf Deutsch sehr schwer zu folgen. Wir hätten uns mehr frische und Schwung erwartet,in den Erzählungen. So wurden Infos sehr runtergerattert. Die Guide ist nicht wirklich auf die Gruppe eingegangen und das iPad für Photos ist ungeschickt  Spiegelt sehr stark und wurde zu schnell weitergegeben.",0

24747,We all had a wonderful time and  it was very informative. Michael was very agreeable with our scheduling challenges.  Our one suggestion would be to maybe have  a seperate person designated to handle the tastings for those people who went on a touras It was very busy at the time of our tasting and there needed to be more people to discuss the samplings and tasting. Not mix with people who did not go on a tour and are just sampling. It was the highlight of our weekend and we look forward to teturning and recommending.  Thank you ,10

29205,"Jon, the Distiller, gave a really interesting tour! He explained the complex chemical processes in an accessible way. We left the tour knowing a lot more, and appreciating all the art, craft, and hard work that goes into a good bottle of booze. Plus, it was all so yummy. Thanks Jon!",9

20743,Excellent communication leading up to the tour. Engaging and interesting tour. ,10
55099,"Loved Carly, as I am sure you heard from prior guests.  I would recommend your tour.   I have not taken the general tour so I cannot compare.  I enjoyed the $55 tour, but if you want honest feedback, for the price, get rid of the bar food and plastic ""souvenir"" cup.  It does not fit the image and was a strange dime-store finish.",7
38584,Great venue thank for an enlightened tour!,10
38569,We like bubba keep up the good work,10
44218,We especially liked that we were able to interact with the horses and to see California Chrome.  We appreciated that we did not feel rushed at the barn stops.,10
44383,We had a great time!  Our guide Olivia was wonderful! She was knowledgeable and very friendly. The farm is beautiful and a joy to walk around. And even though people were working they didn’t make us feel like we were in there way. We will b back again!,10
43483,"The attractions were very interesting, but it was difficult to understand one of the guides so I feel like we missed out on quite a bit of the information.",8
39910,"Tasting area is clean, service is fast and friendly.  Lots of great beers to taste.",10
44007,"Enthusiastic tour guide. Glad to see Chrome enjoying himself outside, but it is hard to get good pictures.  But so cool to feed him! I very much appreciate the chance to be up close with him. And Graydar too!",9
44137,California Chrome Experience was awesome!!!  We had a wonderful up-close encounter with Chrome and other horses on the farm.  Highly recommended!,10
43707,"Bubba took good care of us while we were there.  We didn’t do the tour, but we enjoyed the tasting!",9
44022,Barn full of stellar stallions. Tour guide was friendly and informative. Tour a bit longer than advertised. We were alliwed to pose for photo with Super Saver. All stallions in the upper barn were introduced. ,10
43165,The tour was very interesting ,10
45289,Great pairings!,10
45204,Tour guide was pleasant & knowledgeable. Small group allowed for enjoyable time to learn & ask questions. Wish we could have spent more time on campus but had to get back for meetings. Hope to come again. ,10
55279,I was under the impression of getting a real tour or the factory not just the 15 minute tour we received and I also was not exspecting to pay $4 for a can of beer at a company function that is doing very well off ,0
38378,"I could not hear anything the tour guy was saying on a Saturday night. Maybe you should have a separate room instead of having it in the bar area. Additionally, it would be really nice if really water glasses were available. Not doing water in shot cups. ",4

43167,Because,4
44033,Beautiful farm but next to no time with the stallions. Spent a majority of the time in the breeding shed. All of the tours spend too much time in there. People go to see the horses. Once you have seen one breeding you have seen them all. The horses were out in their paddocks which is great cause you can get nice outside pics. But we didn't walk down the road to see them. We saw two within 50 yes or so. All the rest were a long way away. If they just walked us down the road. Not infringing on the horses but still getting to see them it would be fine. It's not the farms normal tour time and it was obvious it thru them off. All other farms that had horses out let us either walk the paddocks or they brought two or three up close for pics. Great farm but the tour was very dissapointing.,5
45206,My wife Linda is a big fan of anything equestrian and seeing American Pharaoh is very important.  Triple Crown winners are very few.,9
45589,"Tour guide talked a lot, soft tone, could barely hear him. Vodka was ok. Warm, not use to doing that, and we tried only 4 types. My friends who were late for the tour, sat on the bar tasting, and got to taste more than 4 types. Didn’t purchase any vodka. ",3
42869,I wish I could remember our guys name but I do not and I am sorry about that because he was great. Even in the rain he took his time talking with us and he didnt rush us. He was patient with everyone and very knowlegable. Seeing Orbit being fiesty and Warfront enjoying his peppermints was awesome.,10

42215,Absolutely loved this company .... did two different tours through them and they were both great!,10
45311,"We had a GREAT time!  Excellent crew, lots of fun!!",10
55165,"I can appreciate that the distillery is very busy and that producing bourbon is the number 1 priority, but the tour seemed very restrictive and hurried. If you weren't in the front of the group, we could not hear what Casey was saying. We didn't hear anything about the actual distilling process while in the ""sauna"" room. ",7

42216,"This is our third beermaster tour in as many years, and it has never failed us.  This time we had Brandon (?), 12:30 tour on Sunday, March 25.  He was very friendly, knowledgeable, entertaining, and kept everyone in our group engaged, even the poor 17 year-old fellow who couldn’t participate in all activities.  We love, love, love this tour, and tell everyone that if they plan to do a brewery tour, pay the $35 for this one.  They will not be disappointed!",10
41802,We found the tour to be both fun and informative. It included the key distilling facts that make Wild Turkey a world wide stand-out; as well as local lore and personal history. Very nicely done!,10
41801,10,10
43921,Could be a 10 if the tasting included some snacks.,6
44032,We got to see the stallions in their paddocks instead of the barn. We got to see and spent time with the stallions more than before which makes the trip worth while. Please could you possible consider showing some foals on the farm in the future.,10
43709,Tour was good. Guide talked way too fast and was garbled. ,7
44499,Enjoy visiting the farms in the area,10

38460,The tour included historical info about San Francisco that helped make the vacation in San Francisco more meaningful.,9
38697,Not value for money. Not worth 25$,1
40654,Incredible tour,10
40695,Our tour guide was fantastic. However we didn't receive our rum punch cocktail on arrival. We would've also liked to have seen the actual distillery etc. ,7
34641,"Really fun tour with knowledgable, fun staff.  The gin selection was AMAZING!  We each learned something new and walked away with a nice combo of spirits!  (I had tried Shay's rebellion and Two Lanterns in Sept at Sept retreat in Lenox.  LOVED them! ) Was super happy to see where these yummy whiskeys were made.  Super sad to hear that they are a limited batch - bought one of each wish I had bought more.  Might be an excuse to travel the distance from Boston to get it!  ",10
45274,Ian was great host. Seeing Tapit and the other stallions up close was the best. A foaling would be interesting .,10
34674,"We had a late in the day tour/tasting with Michael, who was fantastic. We had a lot of questions and banter and Michael was awesome with our small group. We learned a lot (& have been on these kinds of tours before) and also loved the tasting! Would definitely come back with other friends.",10
34831,"Every spirit we tried was excellent, which is impressive.  Usually we only like some things from different breweries or distilleries, but here everything was good.  We also appreciated being able to try all spirits instead of just a select few.  This really helped us choose what we wanted to buy.  The staff was extremely friendly and personable.  The atmosphere was clean, bright, and comfortable.  This was a great experience.  When we’re in the area again, we’ll definitely stop in again.",10
42872,Very friendly and knowledgeable guide.  We learned so much about the flora and fauna on our hike.,10
44670,The Favella tour with Patrick was absolutely amazing. The information was wonderful and we really enjoyed all the different places we stopped. Patrick's respect for the local people was wonderful and you could see the respect they all have for him in return. Such an enlightening experience.

44014,great hostess/tour guide!  ,10
41573,Ben was awesome ,9
44573,"For us a brewery or distillery tour isn't merely 'another thing to do' when visiting; it offers the connection between the beers we delight in and their place of origin. We were fortunate to have Mike as our docent; he was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and professional; he answered questions with humble authority. The history of Anchor brewery was fascinating. The brewery was spotlessly clean (hats off to the cleaning staff) and the copper vessels are objects of great beauty. We have drunk Anchor Steam and Liberty Ale on and off for thirty years when we find them in the UK, so it was a joy to come and visit the source. All the best for the future.",10
42873,It was very informative and well organized.,10
43487,"I enjoyed your tour so much. The farm is beautiful and the tour guide was wonderful. American Pharoah was all I expected and more..... it was all I could do not to touch him! Along with getting to see that beauty, it was a plus getting to see the other beautiful horses and seeing how a working farm actually works. I've already had several people ask how to purchase tickets.   Thank you and the staff for giving me an opportunity to see a legend .",10
43711,Wonderful tour guide - very friendly and knowledgeable.  Seeing AP in person was amazing!!!  Tour guide took pics for everyone with AP and we were not rushed.  Just an overall amazing experience!!!,10
43832,"Had a great time! Only reason I said 9 rather than 10 was the tour was nothing different than other bourbon  distillery tours. Also seemed to be shorter and not quite as in depth. However, I’ve been on a lot of tours at this point and probably more nit picky than most tourists. Keep up the good work guys! Cheers!",9

36757,Our guide Arturo was great. He added a lot of information about the local area to our tour and really made the experience great for our family!,10
43627,"Bubba was *spectacular.* He was knowledgeable, engaging, and thoroughly entertaining; I don't think we'd have enjoyed our trip to Wild Turkey half as much without him as our tour guide. Great bourbon, of course, too!",10
42275,"Although the building and the history of anchor was cool, The price of the tour is outrageous given the benefits, aka the amount of beer provided and the time allotted to consume it. I had heard legendary stories about this tour from years ago and thought that might explain the month plus wait to get a reservation. Either things have changed drastically or I was misinformed. If you truly want to charge $25 / person. Here are some suggestions on making it worth attending:: Serve beer before the tour. Its a cool spot to hang out. Let people enjoy the space properly.  If you are concerned about over indulging, give them a t-shirt, coffee cup, etc instead of more beer. it’s free advertising and when somebody asks them about the item they won’t say they went on this overpriced brewery tour in SF that was sadly disappointing. You can do better. Constructively critical, Paul Sawicki ",4
41748,"The previous tour we went was was Jim Beams a complete working distillery, all you do there is age.  The tour was educational however it lacked any working parts.  Would recommend but would warn people to have lower expectations.",5

42874,Friendly and informative staff. And great beer!,10
43712,"Interesting, engaging, great beer and we got to taste a good range. Such a cool space, It was an excellent evening ",10
43833,Loved the small farm experience and appreciated the lack of detail regarding breeding that you get at the stud farms.  Better experience when children are with you.  Received a 9 rating because some may be Moore interested in the breeding angle. ,9

44036,"The entire trip was as advertised. Everyone involved from Nepal Eco Adventure was extremely professional, friendly and polite. My only suggestion is that you warn people that when they step outside from Kathmandu Airport that there will be many local men who are grabbing your luggage and trying to get you to give them tips. As a westerner, this is not common and it makes you feel anxious and nervous as you don not know who is representing Nepal Eco Adventures and who is trying to take advantage of you and take your money.

131584,Taylor was our tour guide and you can tell he really enjoys what he does and is a great and enthusiastic story teller. The brewery is really awesome and to get to see the inner workings of the operation was a great way to spend a Saturday morning. ,10
39952,Very friendly and a great product!,10
133628,"I wouldn't say great. About average tour in historic buildings. Buildings, history being the main draw. Gift bottle at the end is just a bottle. Nothing special to keep. The attempted sale of picture at end of tour is just a money grab. Compared to the past premiums on display it was kind of insulting. Our tour guide was very knowledgable and personable. Helped with details about town after the tour also.",7
41749,Jerrod was a knowledgeable tour guide who was clearly passionate about beer.,10
43836,"I loved the facility, the people, the tour, the restaurant, the fact that you showed us all facets of the farm, that you place the welfare of horses first. My only disappointment was that Chrome didn't come galloping over the hill to receive his guests and eat cookies. However, I loved that Graydar did feel like mixing with us humans and he greeted us very eagerly. I also loved the little Chrome filly out of Dr..Fager's Gal. She stole my heart. Next time I will.sign up for the Chrome tour.  ",9

135442,"Tom Morgan did a very good job leading our tour. He is very knowledgeable and excited to be a part of the whole operation. I love how every employee that we have encountered is fully invested in the Bentley Heritage Vision. As a lifelong resident of our beautiful valley, I feel very proud that we have such a wonderful addition to our community. ",10
133700,The guide was very friendly and could answer all of the questions that our group had.,10
136842," We were lucky enough to only have five people on our tour so it was a very individual experience. I appreciated being able to go behind the scenes, even being able to dip our finger in the vat of mash! I was very impressed with how small the operation is and how clean the whole process was as well. I bought three bottles and I’m not even normally a spirits drinker. Thank you again. ",10

43492,"I think we could have had more interaction at the daycare center towards the end, maybe learn a little more about the importance of having one in the favela. The guide spoke very quickly and was a little hard to understand at times but overall was wonderful!",8

124140,"From the initial contact and requesting a quote, through the entire service, RE Transfer was incredible professional, proactive, communicative, and helpful. Especially given the large size of the group and the complicated flight schedules, I really appreciated all the effort and excellent work that RE Transfer undertook. I would absolutely recommend them for other corporate transportation logistics needs in Panama. ",10

137439,The guide was amazing! So friendly and provided alot of information. The farm itself is beautiful and horses I was able meet are spectacular! If you love horses and horse racing Claiborne Farm is thr perfect place to visit! Charming and so much history!!!,10
43717,"Beautiful farm, love the family history of father and brothers, Loved seeing California Chrome and the other gorgeous stallions as well as the moms and babies there in spring. Carly did an amazing job on the tour. She is welcoming, upbeat, friendly and knowledgeable. Great experience all around.",10
43714,Very informative guide. Tried to accommodate all requests within reason. Would definitely do again. ,10
44761,"I bought this experience as a Christmas present for my husband as his favourite whisky is Famous Grouse. Although Famous Grouse is not actually made on the premises the tour was very interesting and informative about the whisky making process and Lindsay, our guide, was more than happy to answer any questions and was very knowledgeable. An enjoyable hour rounded off with free tasters of a couple of different whiskies - my husband thoroughly enjoyed himself! All the staff were very pleasant and friendly which makes such a difference to the overall enjoyment of the tour. I would definitely recommend to others.",9

44281,The Brewery was amazing and out tour guide Jamie was over the top AWESOME!!! Just awesome!! The only drawback was the rude young lady at the gift shop counter who got rather belligerent with my wife. All in all we loved it though.,10

41579,"The service was incredible, Tina and Adrian made the experience memorable.",10
43338,"I took a tour at Taylor Made last year during the same weekend, and I have to say that I feel like this was completely different. It was not as personable as last year's visit. We had Phil as our guide last year and he was very knowledgeable and answered all of our group's questions. This year's tour group was much larger, and our guide seemed like more of an entertainer than a horse savy person. I wouldn't recommend marketing Chrome as much during a tour when you don't actually see him. Obviously he's a breeding horse on his own schedule being out in his field and I understood that, but many of the people in the tour were not pleased they didn't see him. I really feel like the tour this year was more about rushing around and not seeing much at all in the terms of the horses. I am not one of those interested in purchasing merchandise, I'm there to learn about the history of the farm and some of the famous faces out in the fields. I just felt the tour itself was lacking in the quality that I experienced last year. At this point, I wouldn't recommend a tour to Taylor Made to others. I understand it's a working horse farm, but this is where I would think you don't need a restaurant or a golf course on property. ",3
43630,"From beginning to end we enjoyed! The staff were friendly and informative. A very enjoyable experience, thank you!",10
44750,"Bubba is super rad.  Loved getting an in depth look at the things that I like to see the most, from the open fermentors to the still itself and the barrels, and, most importantly, the tasting",10

45277,Fabulous experience ,10
45064,"Loved the building, Clydesdales,  the Bud puppy, beer sampling.  However, the tour guide, talked so fast we couldn't understand her.  We also should have picked a different tour which talked more about the making of the beer, actually seeing it being made, bottling it, etc.  ",5
45042,Was a definitely a excellent tour. The tour guide was super informative she showed us everything. I would recommend this tour over all others,10
42507,Friendly atmosphere. Lots of history to understand. Worth to have a visit. My Son did really enjoy,8

37293,"Bo was excellent, and fun tasting. But why twice as expensive as Four Roses? Strongly recommend option to tour, taste, or both so not sitting and waiting over an hour for first available. ",9

44516,"Captain Jack and the Crew are very knowledgeable of the area. We had great time. While taking the voyage, we felt safe at all times.",10
43496,Our guide was great. Seeing it all was fun & educational. Of course Your bourbons was marvelous!!!  ;),10
34017,"This was the worst thing we've done in all our time in Europe. Instead of a small, local place we were taken to a tourist trap run by the guide's friends (and encouraged to order 'extras' to pay him in cash). The food was disgusting and we learned nothing about fado. It was a complete waste of money and I would discourage anyone else from ever doing this.",0
44757,The tour guide was very informative and interactive with the people. And had a sense of humor. She made it fun ,10
44581,Guide was fantastic,10
44506,"We had a great tour experience, and loved talking to Olivia, the intern, afterward. She was lovely. A great day at the barn! ",10
44691,Wonderful facility...great and knowledgeable tour guide...very interesting ,10
44752,We have visited Coolmore once before and this time the tour guide was a little nicer....I don't see why we can't touch any of the horses...all the other farms allow us to at least pet the horses and since you do have a triple crown winner you need to understand that people are going to want to touch him!   Coolmore has never been a farm we enjoy visiting. The only reason we came is seeing a TC winner was on my bucket list.  I wish you were more welcoming like Taylor Made or Claiborne. ,5
44982,Rocco did a great job.   Answered questions.   Took his time.  Had a good sense of humor. ,9
2991,,10
2716,Yva was a great guide! She provided loads of interesting facts in a very entertaining way! Made us fall in love with Vienna! And provided great recommendations about things to do after our tour.,10
6593,"1st off. I'm not just the average off the street shmo wanting to just taste. I wanted to learn more about the distillery, process, and meet the head distiller. Your spirits are top notch, I'd recommend them to anyone. The spirits tasting was pricey for what you got out of it. The bartender I would debate about being an expert as it pertains to distilling and spirits. Great mixologist? Maybe. Good personally? Yep. Expert that you want leading info about your distilled spirits? Perhaps needs some refinement and more education. Great guy though. My t-shirt purchased also was a bummer. Had a loss thread and the stitching on the  neck came unraveled. Hummer for a 25 dollar purchase. Your the distillerys fault though. Still, a nice atmosphere and enjoyable afternoon. Wish we would have been able to see the stills, get more detailed info on still capacity, manufacturing output per year and why the eff we can't get hotaling anywhere... 100% rye... Doesn't that turn I to glue? How do you distill it? Are you using enzymes? Etc... ",5
30866,"Overall the person who led our tasting did a good job and was knowledgeable about his product.  However, he never came out from behind the bar to interact with those of us who were seated at tables instead of at the bar.  Also, I had reserved and paid extra for the birthday package for my friend.  He handed a package to someone else but had nothing ready for my friend.  When I said something to him, we were told we could ""just pick a shirt off the rack"".  No apologies were offered.  He did find a bag and gave us the glass that was supposed to be part of the package.  Also, when we asked him where we could purchase some of the spirits we had tried, we got ""Not here."" and the names of some liquor stores.  No explanation of why they weren't available there or at the tasting room across the street.  Overall I didn't feel it was the best value for the money paid.",5
31009,The tasting started very informative and interesting then ended. We were allowed to hangout in the space for some time afterwards but for an hour tasting we only got 15 minutes of info. It would have been neat to learn to make 1-2 cocktails with the spirits we tasted. The instructor seemed disinterested in promoting the brand/experience. Overall disappointed with the tasting experience but very impressed with the tasting room space and spirits themselves.,4
43840,"The employees, current and retired, who provided the introduction and led the tours were informed and pleasant.  The museum exhibits were interesting.  (The Shadow motorcycle was cool.)  The tour of the factory was fascinating.  It reminded me of a fast-paced animation of industrialization, with sounds and smells, and humans instead of cartoon figures.  I was surprised by the age of the building.",10
2347,Love the beers ,10
2798,The beer was very good and the tour guide was also very good.  The service was poor.  The waitress was rude and defensive.  We were instructed to sit at the high top tables after the tour because we just wanted to drink a bit more beer.  No one came over to serve us and we were not informed that there would be no service at the high top tables.  What is needed is better communication and more polite wait staff.,4
1647,"Overall a really professional, fun and enjoyable experience!   Also unique for those who live here and also for team building, out of town guests.  Annie is terrific as a driver and host - personable and authentic.  Well organized at breweries we visited, overall seemed easy to taste, etc.",10

2002,"The tour started promptly, and for almost 3 hours we walked throughout the streets if Vienna. The guide Iva really knew her stuff and really made the trip! It was informative and relevant but we also got to see the main places to visit even if you needed to go back and revisit as we did. Very interesting ",10
5172,No se escuchaba bien. Siento que me perdí bastantes partes del tour. Además camina muy rápido a veces era difícil se seguir y cuando llegabamos ya había empezado a explicar,5
44956,Awesome tour that came with complimentary beer!,10
55180,"What a gorgeous farm and an incredible experience!  It was so great to have such an extensive tour and to see so much, but the best part was the amount of time we got to spend in the stallion barn...it's was just awesome to see so many beautiful stallions and to see a little bit of their personalities, and it was WONDERFUL to be able to get so close to Super Saver!!  Thank you!!!",10
43841,"In comparing tours, we just rode  on shuttle to see foals in fields..at a distance.   Other farms are more up close",8

44613,"My First Name is "" Dale W"" in which it is how I registered.  Very insulting by changing a person's name.  /s/  dale w  Dale W ""Dale W"" Turner  (YES!!!  My First Name is ""Dale W"".)",7
44736,As a life long Bay Area resident I have never taken a tour of the brewery.  Not only was the tour informative about the brewery I also learned some San Francisco history.  And of course the tasting was generous.  ,10

So today,I clime up all the stairs to St.Stefan or I now know the different between the Sacher Torte and theDemel Torte or I am looking forward to the Crowns in The Hofburg! It is very good that you have a guide, who knows many things about history and who is so exellent, that she (or he) can ""macht dich neugierig auf mehr!"" Sorry!

2427,Very good tour very well presented by Iva.,9
5614,The tour was a good overview of one ring area. The people were grouped by language with a guide speaking that language. Size was manageable. Tour time was good as crowds came out later. And price was right - fair goodwill gratuity.,8

41591,"Very informative, fun and great value for money",10
42228,"Overall, the tour was lackluster. While there is some understanding that our tour guide was new, it felt like she was truly unprepared to give a tour- as she was reading material off her phone and it seemed she couldn't answer very many questions. Most of the reason I gave a 5 instead of a lower score was for the older women assisting with the tour- she seemed very knowledgeable and charismatic. The property is also beautiful.",5

My 10 year old daughter was entertained throughout with how interactive the tour was and all of the extra details, I.e. wood chips, foxes, elephants, glass grain displays, etc. Her only complaint was she wished she had seen one of the Dalmations. : )",10
44420,"We were delighted with our tour of Claiborne Farm. Our tour guide Kevin was articulate, knowledgeable and friendly.  I consider Claiborne holy ground, and it was wonderful to get the history and the philosophy of the farm, as well as the opportunity to meet some of the stallions. Meeting War Front was very special.

43637,"The presenter was great but wanted to share honest feedback. It was a little hard to hear with the windows and sirens and car alarms going off. Enjoyed the history but a little too in-depth. For beer buffs it was probably great but for others it might have a been a bit too much as I️ noticed people’s eyes wandering. It could have definitely been made up if the machinery was running so that it could have been a balanced experienced but because it was a maintenance day, nothing was really happening. It was a little disappointing but wanted to share feedback so perhaps on those maintenance days you can inform guests before they come so they know what to expect.

43042,"I was very disappointed with the tour as it was basically a wearhouse now. This was my fourth tour and the worst by far. We should have been informed before purchasing tickets that everything was being moved to Etobicoke. The ""Steam Whistle"" wasn't even operating. We had to ""imagine"" the bottle line, etc as it was just an empty space. It's great that you are turning the space into an entertainment venue and moving the operation to a larger building, but I would have liked a headed up. $10 for a walk through a wearhouse and one beer wasn't worth it. Sorry, I won't be recommending your ""tour"" to anyone.",1

California chrome not coming over was a bummer, but to be honest Graydar is my favorite. Being able to feed the stallions is amazing and not allowed on most other farms. Just an incredible farm, the history of it. We even had lunch at Daddy Joe's and got to see one of the owners. The staff at the farm is the nicest group of people. From our tour guide to the folks in Daddy Joes. Thank you.",9

44148,Great experience!,10
44434,"The distillery tour is very informative, the rack house built in 1894 is worth the price alone.  The tasting really broke down the differences between there Bourbons.  We we're lucky and went on a 9 am tour, it was myself my wife and son, the guide was excellent highly recommend going early.  As a  side we got to meet Jimmy Russell who was so accommodating signed a couple of bottles and had our picture taken with him.  The view outside the distillery is Kentucky.

The one girl needed note cards to tell us about each stallion, and Distorted Humor, Pioneer of the Nile, and Speightown were all out in their paddocks.  Also only saw one of the Stallion Barns.  Sadly I also did not have a good experience when I joined Stablemates.  There is so much more information that should be given on the stallions.  Fans need to feel more welcomed.",2

43938,We were concerned that we did not get our second email with respect to pick up time until nearly midnight the night before our 7:30 a.m. tour.  Consideration should be given to folks having to get up prior to 6 a.m. and not providing the info until 6 hours before puck up.  ,7
44903,Extensive tour by people very interested in showing the facility and what goes on there.,8
44594,"Claiborne is my #1 farm to visit. I've been coming to KY since 1996 and have booked visits both directly with the farm as well as HorseCountry. I absolutely love coming here -everyone is so wonderful to fans and I could easily spend all day! There may be more modern, fancier stud farms but the history and simplicity of Claiborne makes is #1 on my list. I particularly like to be there at the time of year when the stallions are out in their paddocks during tour times -- it's great to see them grazing, running to get a peppermint or otherwise just showing off -- simply being a horse.  Thanks for allowing us to come see the boys - it's always a treat ! ",10

We were able to see all the stallions up close (Bernardini and Frosted were brought out) but we were also able to able to see Medaglia d’Oro in his stall. Then our guides brought us over to the foaling barn and allowed us as much time as we wanted to take pictures with and pet the new foals and the mares.

43641,The tour was super fun! Andreu was really entertaining and informative. We learned so much about the history of Anchor as well as the brewing process.

38468,Awesome tour. Had a great time with my friends --Gillian,9
24363,We waited half an hour in the rain and the tour was cancelled as you required a minimum of 10 people. I think 7 or 8 people showed up for the english walking tour - maybe you could consider lowering the minimum number. ,5
24357,It wasn't as good as tours I've done in other European cities. It was more of a show and tell of buildings and didn't really have a great historical story weaved through. It provided a good orientation to the city but I would have expected it to be more interesting. ,4
24418,I booked online but when I got there was told it was full so I missed out,5
44580,"Although it was nice that you offer many kinds of beer,I wish you offered a can of beer which I can bring home instead of many glasses, as I cannot drink much at one time.

44626,Very wonderful.  Wish there was more literature so much information couldn’t remember to share,10
43854,Meeting Jimmy Russell and Family was very cool.  Good history and product ( I am not a bourbon drinker but loved American Honey).  I would suggest some work on landscaping.  The other distilleries have you guys beat in this area for sure. I live in the nursery capital of the world so I am probably more sensitive to that than the average persons.  Thanks for every thing.

3342,"We had a very special day in London with Paul Murphy of Black Cab Heritage Tours. We only had two days in London, so we decided to take a full day tour. Paul was excellent. He was professional, knowledgeable and most pleasant. He drove us all over the city and we saw everything and then some., including Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, all of the funny-shaped but beautiful modern buildings, Tower of London, The London Eye, bridge after bridge, monument after monument, We got out of the cab and walked for some parts, seeing the Changing of the Guards at Buckingham Palace, the replica Globe Theatre where Shakespeare's plays were presented, St. Paul's Cathedral, Parliament buildings, ancient Roman amphitheatre, art gallery and many other places. It rained a little bit, but Paul was well equipped with umbrellas for each of us. Paul's historic knowledge was extensive and impressive. There wasn't a question that he could not answer. We stopped for a very nice lunch and had great conversations with Paul. He knew lots of cool things, like how gum stuck to the floor of a walking bridge became a great canvas for tiny art. Paul didn't just show us St. Paul's Cathedral, but took us up to a tall building from which to see it - a beautiful view.  Rob Woodford, of Black Cab Heritage Tours was also wonderful to work with. We highly recommend this company. It was a relaxing, comfortable way to see everything without the hassle of lineups or catching buses. Definitely ask for Paul!!! ",10
6857,"The whole experience was fantastic from start to finish. The email communication between myself and Rob was great. He understood that there were mobility issues with members of my group and was thoughtful and accommodating throughout. Our guide, Mike, was first class. He was very knowledgeable and has a lovely presentation style. We asked lots of questions and he went out of his way to show take my mother down memory lane from when she worked in London to showing me the policemans coathook which is something I've wanted to see for years.   Great service and great tour. I couldn't recommend the company enough. ",10
7595,"Being our first trip to London, we wanted to get an overall tour of the city so we would have an idea of what to expect. Boy we got so much more than an overalll tour! Graham provided very cool and interesting facts and history of all the key sites and even not so key sites. I think theBlack cab tour is the Best way to see the city. You learn so much and really get the best bang for your buck or pounds! Haha.   I truly appreciate the rich culture and history of London!  My family truly enjoyed our tour! Thanks",10
40838,"I was a little disappointed that the Premier Classic Tour was mostly the Old London and the City. We did not drive by classic London places like Regent St  Piccadelly St, Bond Street, HydePark, Notting Hill, and most visited landmarks. We spend too much time parked in areas with no much interest to us.  Driver’s stories were  hard to listen because he had no speakers working on the back. In genesral, I will not recommend the tour to anyone, however Steve the driver was a real nice and was always cordial and pleasant.  ",3
43734,Loved everything we got to see and our guide was awesome/Jeff,10

44429,It was a great tour and I don't even like beer. Wish the clydesdales were there ,9
141391,Intressant och god mat!,10
43027,Super tour and amazing place to see. We were a little spoiled last year because we had a small group and we got to feed alot of the stallions peppermints. We also got to walk out and get pics with and feed Pioneer of the nile. The new extended tour was nice. But if you actually got to stop and get out and see Pioneer of the nile. If you got to stop and go in a foaling barn to see foals. Even if the tour guides could tell you some of the sites of the goals you drive by. I'm sure you have some well known mares if they could tell you that it would also improve it. Especially going by the maiden mares. They are right from the track. Many folks would recognize who they were. A little more time with the stallions when there is such a big group would be great also. ,8
43902,"Shingo Kukiyama, our driver, was a fantastic host, very friendly and informative (and fit!), and included a rarely visited temple in our itinerary. I think the experience is dependent on the driver and Kuki made our trip a memorable one.",9
41603,"Staff, facility, and tour was great. Only reason it is a 9 instead of a 10 is the product, just not my favorite bourbon.",9
41767,"Clean facility, easy to find, and relaxing!  ",10
43864,Tour was great but no bells and whistles to make it an experience to remember or something that set it apart from the others.  ,9
43512,Overall a decent experience but probably better for beer enthusiasts.  Issues with the equipment got us off to a late start but we received the full tour.  Free parking and nice tour guide was a bonus.,7
43335,"Spectacular facilities, beautiful setting, amazing horses, incredibly interesting from an operations/industry standpoint. The young ladies who were our tour guides were wonderful. Please convey to Kenny Troutt how much we enjoyed our visit to WinStar (3/31) and that we hope to see him on another visit! Wishing you all continued success. Many thanks and best regards... George Beukema and Karen Littig",10
43474,The tour guide was outstanding! She was very personable and knowledgeable! The only suggestion would be to make the sign : Breeding barn larger.  It was difficult to see and know exactly where to turn in off Pisgah Rd. ,10
43876,"wonderful experience, great history.",9
43859,The young lady who gave us the tour was very knowledgeable. We brought my father who is 80 years old and she spoke slow enough for him to hear and understand.  We were all very impressed with how nice and clean everything was on the tour. ,10
27582,The guide was very old and boring,4
44431,Excellent tour...always a great time!!,10
41602,Tour guid was very thourall answered all questions. Felt like she new the distillery history,10
44889,"Many reasons actually. Our wonderful driver Ayamu Tamaki was so obliging & took us around the quieter streets explaining so much. He took some amazing photos with my iPhone that we will share. The Rickshaw was so well presented, lovely & clean. A fabulous experience whilst holidaying in Japan. ",10
45061,"Very nice visit. They brought out American Pharoah then got to see most of the stallions. Our guide was very friendly, knowledgeble, and made us feel that we were welcome (I've been to Ashford on some previous occasions where we felt like we were imposing).  I would make one suggestion: While I realize that the tour times are at the convenience of the farms, it would be nice if they were not scheduled at times the stallions are being fed. What we mostly get to see are the stallions with their heads in their feed buckets. ",10
44924,Our tour guide went above and beyond on our tour and gave us a really memorable experience. ,10
44878,Your facility is awesome!  I loved watching an actual surgery being performed  and then getting to meet the vet who explained what I witnessed.   Then I got to meet and give treats to the blood donor horse's.  I learned so much about horses and their care.   I'm planning to return later this year with my family. ,10
44945,"very cool site, guide was awesome. ",10
44764,"This was an opportunity of a lifetime to not only see Chrome, but give him a pet and have your picture taken with him.  His handler did a marvelous job with him. Chrome was regal and relaxed.  It was also great to see the mares and new foals. I do few suggestions to make the experience better, however. It was not clear that the ""Visitor Center"" was the golf course restaurant and not the actual visitor center at the farm. Nor was it stated that it was a caravan driving situation. Also, if you provide extra brochures or literature for the participants, you should have enough for all your customers. Thank you for your hospitality!",10
44962,"Gainesway was wonderful. Ian Trapp, a frequent contributor to THE BLOOBHORSE, was our tour guide. It was great to have someone with so much pedigree knowledge introduce us to the likes of Tapit, Empire Maker, Afleet Alex, Birdstone and Hat Trick. Don't miss going here! ",10
44597,"Friendly, knowledgeable guide; prompt pick-up; lots of fun.",10
44853,"I wasn’t there yesterday, but the last time I visited your farm I really had a good time. Yesterday I was working in North Little Rock, Arkansas. You can send me some free passes, I’ll be in town the week of the Derby . Thanks l",10
43944,Tour guides were awesome - everyone so friendly and funny!  A great experience!,10
44838,"We did get a very informative, friendly, fun and professional brewery tour the other Day!",10
45556,It was not boring.... we had an awesome tour guide! ,10
45320,Delicious amd a great value,10
44925,"Awesome guide, fun, great information, beautiful tour ",10
44951,"This was my second visit to Gainesway (first was several years ago)  Ian Tapp gave us an amazing tour. He shared so much information and history about the farm and gave so much detail.  It is evident that this is a first class operation and we were grateful to be given such an insight. Seeing the stallions, of course, was the highlight.  Gainesway treats them like the royalty they are and the grooms were very patient and generous with their time, posing the horses so that we could get many pictures.  There were so many questions asked and Ian took the time to answer all of them, however, this did extend the visit time to the point that we had to make our exit before everything wrapped up (I imagine there wasn't much more left as we were on our way back to the starting point by then)  I hope we didn't give the impression that we were disinterested but we had another farm tour scheduled and had at least a thirty minute drive.  If you can, please extend our appreciation and thanks to both Ian and the farm for making this a very special visit. It was also very nice to see a very young foal with her mother!  ",10
42359,Alex followed thru on getting me an answer I had asked him. He was truthful enough to say he didn't know but got me the answer by asking the right person. Very respectable. Thanks again Alex. ,8
42463,"Not very friendly.  Expensive, $11/ person, for just tasting no tours.",3
44751,We came down to go to beer school! I've never been to your property before.  I was impressed.  What a  great atmosphere.  Beer school was fun and informative.  I am planning on coming back soon.,10
42768,"Kind, informative and friendly tour  It is evident that the horses at Saxony Farm are well cared for and ‘part of the family’. ",10
44765,We visited numerous farms and by far your tour was the best and the most personable!,10
44526,We always enjoy our visits to WinStar. Thank you for opening your doors to casual (yet passionate) racing fans and treating us with the same courtesy as owners and breeders. WE understand the magnitude of operating a huge and successful business and appreciate having a glimpse into the lives of these famous horses. Your farm is beautiful and it's always a treat to visit.  (p.s.  love the little gift shop; I predict you may have to enlarge it ! ) ,10
44601,"Bubba was our guide, and you could tell he enjoyed his job, knew his material and helped make the tour educational and enjoyable.  the tasting room views were fantastic, and the bourbon was great",10
44063,Aaron was very knowlegable about the forest and living species. He made the discovery experience a fabulous one.,10
44786,"Great tour guide, lovely facility and beautiful stallions.  Would love to do it again.",10
41770,"The guide was not well trained. She will eventually be good, but should not have been leading a tour group prior to knowing the script. ",6
44807,"Tapit ...need I say more? However, your was also informative and the farm beautiful. I especially liked the architecture of the stallion barns.",10
44831,"Great people, great horses, great tour! 👍",10
42360,Vivian was excellent. Jimmy was missed. ,10
44702,Great presentation!,10
42901,Andru was very knowledgeable tour guide. He was also patient and answered everyone’s questions. Great experience!!,10
43195,Friendly staff made changing tour days easy.  ,6
44780,"We were able to see all the stallions up close.  Most people came to see Tapit, but we came to see Empire Maker and Afleet Alex.",10
43515,"I've been on several tours,  but yours was one of the most educational and inclusive ones we have been too.  Oh,and you have a rare gem in Bubba.  His energy and excitement was electric.  I just wanted to buy some Wild Turkey and bring him home for a night around the fire pit.  Wild Turkey is our go to for football tailgating.  And at WVU we tailgate BIG!  We now have some new stories to share and a new appreciation for our favorite libation.  ",10
44902,Tour was intimate and came to see Empire Maker. Was lovely afternoon and I am very appreciative to be able to see him. ,10
44437,The tour was awesome.  Up close with the horses was great.  Rodeo was a wonderful guide.  We really enjoyed the tour and would do it again!!!,10
44527,Very informative and interesting,10
44628,I loved our guide. His name was Bubba and he made it really fun and interesting.  ,8
44310,We had a great time. The tour was very informative. We will go again soon.,10
43946,"It was a very nice visit. I got to see most of the stallions and got some pretty good photos. Our guide, Autrey, was very friendly, cooperative, and knowledgeable. I felt welcomed. Along with some friends, I visited Spendthrift a few years ago. It was not anywhere nearly as pleasant as this one (we kind of felt we were imposing).  ",10
44875,The history and land was very interesting to hear about. Love the horses.  It would be great if we could get a closer look to some of the other stallions too. All in all great!,9
44775,It was one of the most informative tours we’ve been on. We are definitely there for the horses but our guide discussed the history of the farm as well as the land and area around it. Talked about many well known names in the thoroughbred industry.... Whitney’s ect. Loved it and will be back. 🐎,10
44788,"My wife and I come to kentucky every April and October. Not just for Keeneland, but to tour the amazing horse farms. Our Gainesway experience was better than we expected. From the welcome, through the tour, to after the tour. We will definitely be going to Gainesway again and again in the future! ",10
32824,Not very good guide. Too big group.,1
32228,"The tour was very slow. There were many anecdotes but not a lot of information about the city, history of the city, orientation etc. felt like we could have learned more from our guid book’s walking tour. ",5
29896,"Informationsgehalt gering, sprachlich auf keinem guten Niveau und daher nur mit Mühe zu verstehen. Schade!",2
44766,The tour was good but too short. Seeing Tapit was wonderful but the farm had a great history that needs to be told.,10
262569,Fun instructor ,10
43516,Was told a van was coming to pick us up. Instead we got a small suv and a sedan for the 8 or us plus an enormous amout of luggage. The driver was early and managed to cram everything in. Thankfully the hotel was very close to the airport. ,6
41606,Great guide.  Beautiful Clydesdales.  Very educational.  Impressive operation.  Free beer. 😃. Great gift shop.,10
43863,Bubba was the best tour guide we had while on the trail.,10
41771,Such a cool tour. Very informative. Great history in the structures. ,10
41832,Loved the tour.   The history.   It would be nice to walk from end to end where barrels are stored. Those buildings are the most fascinating.   ,10
43196,Nice tour to take friends and family from out of town. Tour guide was new to the gig and didn’t have an answer to many questions. ,6
43361,"Loved our very knowledgeable tour guide, loved getting to know the history of Anchor, and REALLY loved all the delicious beer!!",10
44065,Great tour guide. He was very personable and we could tell he really enjoyed his job.,10
42361,Yan was an amazing guide and very knowledgeable. The hike was challenging at times which was exciting. The views were spectacular.,10
31358,"We were more than 30, maybe even more than 35 people in the beginning and people joined us on the go and left during the tour. The groups are just way too big. I couldn't hear our guide and she wasn't waiting for everyone, not even for an elderly couple. I did a free tour in Barcelona, they allow a maximum of 10 people, the guide knows the people, even their names and its better for him/her as everyone feels responsible to stay through the hole thing and pay the tip. Sorry, we were very unhappy with the tour.",1
31914,Because after the break the guide left without waiting almost half of the group. So far it was really interesting ,6
31918,"The tour was great at first, We had a 20min break in the middle; when we got back (on time) at the meeting point, our guide was already gone. We found 8 other people that were in the same position as us. I don't get why she woûd leave early without 10 members of the tour.",6
33974,"not very engaging, and therefore a lot of the information went through one ear and just flowed out the other ",5
43741,Just an incredible tour. By adding the cart so you get to see the mares and goals and the rest of the farm truly made it special. You got an immense amount of time with the stallions and the mares and foals. It made you not feel rushed and made you feel like you could take time with each horse. Also they took Frosted and Bernadini out which allowed for awesome pictures. Great tour.,10
44529,Informative history and good people giving tours and selling merchandise ,10
43866,Interesting tour led by a fun guide.,10
41833,"Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and witty. And, when combined with the learning experience, it made our tour a memorable one.",10
43948,We had a memorable experience in Kyoto!  Takuto was our driver.  He was fun and knowledgeable about the area.  He took amazing photographs of us In the Gion and surrounding area.   We will always remember this special day❤️.  Thank you and thank you Takuto👍,10
42242,Nice tour...not too long or short and two free samples of beer.,9
41772,Lies,0
44769,Great horses and guide,10
44844,"Beautiful, informative, small group ",10
42903,We had a great time! Enjoyed our guide too,10
44630,"Great tour and tasting. Interesting seeing how a large distillery operates on scale. Bubba our guide was a hoot, but you all know that. Imparted history and details in a very understandable nature. Tasting setting excellent, fantastic view. Well done. ",10
42410,"Our tour guide, Bubba was very knowledgeable and helpful. And of course the bourbon was great!",10
44314,10,10
44710,The tour was one of the best we have been on. Presentation of American Pharo was good and allowing us all to get pictures with him was special. Thank you.,10
44857,The only drawback was that one of the buildings on the tour was being cleaned with a leaf blower which caused the group to change locations until the cleaning was done.  It just happened to be snowing and less than 40 deg. on 4/7/18 so extra time in the cold was tough.,9
44843,Loved the close up look at an Equine hospital ,10
32942,"Sehr große Touristengruppe (etwa 25 Personen. Interessante Führung mit vielen Details, jedoch eher weniger für junge Leute geeignet. Auch hätten wir gerne mehr von Wiens Sehenswürdigkeiten gesehen. In 2,5 Stunden sind wir maximal 1,5 km gegangen. Auch hätten wir gerne einige Geheimtipps erfahren die nützlich gewesen wären. Dass die Tour gratis war fanden wir sehr gut, und auch dass man geben konnte was man wollte.",4
43199,Love everything about the farm horse and people. Will be back.,10
43867,Awesome! More tastings on the beer master tour would make it 11 of 10. ,10
44067,"Terrific explanation of the process of raising foals and the history and philosophy of the farm.  Great first hand examples and stories of how certain foals were being cared for due to cracked ribs, etc.  Viewed mother who was colicky and subsequently, saw a ""day in the life"" at Denali.  Tour guide never talked down to us, but rather gave us easy-to-understand, engaging explanations.",8
42243,It was a great tour- lots of animals to see and a fantastic guide! ,10
41773,"It was a great tour and really fun, but the tour guides spoke really fast so at times it was really tough to know what they were saying.  And I'm young, so it wasn't age that made it tough to follow along!",8
43949,The tour guide was very informative and knew a lot about the brewery. It was a great tour and we had great beer. ,10
44127,"The tour guide, Jared had a great presentation style.  Really enjoyed hearing the history of the brewery and its impact on beer styles.",10
43742,Very nice very impressed ,10
43646,Great tour guide. Lots of beer,10
44842,"We learned so much, hadfun, and had ALL of our MANY questions answered!",10
44858,"We had a great time, tour guide was fabulous, we would recommend to anyone in the area.",9
42142,It’s a good whisky I just prefer other whiskey ,6
1058,Great experience and the team had a real passion for your beers,8
34855,"Not planned, uninteresting",2
35952,"Ich hatte den Eindruck dass die Führerin uns eher ihre lieblings Lokale zeigte und weniger zu der Geschichte einzeiner Gebäude wusste. Auch erzählte sie z.B nichts zu der Pestsäule und deren entstehung, nur das die Habsburger ein hervorstehendes Kinn hatten wie man auch an der Säule sehen konnte. Ich beendetet die Tour frühzeitig.",4
42538,"When we arrived, the staff at the desk was too busy talking about lunch plans to greet customers, and then we weren't signed in correctly and had to come back to the desk.  The tour that left before ours had a tour guide that was clearly ""phoning it in"" delivering the opening speech in the tour departure area in a rushed monotone that could barely be understood.  Our guide was pretty good by comparison, but not the crisp professionals we have had in the past.  Didn't like being forced to take pictures and then have to deal with someone selling them to you.",7
42108,The free tour is very basic and gives you a slight glimpse of the day to day operations of the brewery.  Tour groups are large and at times ours was loud making it difficult to hear the guide.  ,7
42244,,9
42202,"I have been on this tour three times, but it was the first tour for everyone else in my group. Our guide Chris was simply awesome. We was genuine and knowledgeable. Also, he made a Slurms Mackenzie reference which was one of the best things I've ever witnessed. Thanks for making this AB experience the best one yet and keep up the great work!",10
41728,"I can't recall his name, but the gentleman who gave our brewmasters tour on 3/23 at 12:30 was the key. He was personable, funny, and well informed on all topics of the tour. He even gave our group dinner suggestions for people who were out of towners, and kept everything interesting and moving. ",10
42161,Alex was an amazing guide!!,10
42020,"Seeing and hearing about the history of the Budweiser brewery was great. Seeing how ornate the brewery is was great. The Clydesdales and Dalmatians were great. One suggestion is don't hurry us quite as much. Loved it, will be back for the more involved tour next time we are in St Louis.",10
42013,"Our instructor was very interactive and personable, we loved him!!",10
42066,"It was a very simple tour and educational! Being part of a manufacturing family I would of loved to have seen the bottling process but also understand the limitations of tours as well! Horses were my favorite because who doesn't love the Budweiser Clydesdales!?! The grounds are gorgeous! Only suggestion is maybe add another bar at the end of the tour, there was literally 80 people ahead of us and we never got our free beer and we paid for our tour, so that was kind of a bummer! ",10
41732,"Great tour, enjoyed the campus, old buildings, info about brewing, the stables, and the bier garden ",10
41966,"The tour was fantastic. My only observation that might warrant some thought is it would be wonderful if each entry/exit and sidewalks to the various spaces, e.g., the paddock, the beechwood tanks, etc., had covered walking and wait areas. Standing in the cold rain, hot humid summer sun and snow is not very comfortable, especially for families with infants, toddlers and small children.",7
42183,"Large brewery, stables were fantastic, a lot of samples, we enjoyed it very much, unique compared to other tours and a great price",10
43743,"Friendly, clean, informative, ",10
44158,I love the pride everyone has working there.  I do not like beer.  But I have been trying to learn more about it.  I wanted to be able to sit and have a beer with my Adult Sons.   I truly loved the mango beer.   Anchors tour was wonderful.  I could taste the history of Anchor in the samples.  I even enjoyed the Porter.  It was very interesting.  Such a great day spent with our Sons at Anchor.  Derick was DELIGHTFUL in the tap room next store.  He took the time to chat with us and made us feel like VIPs.  🤓,10
41610,John our tour guide was awesome!......I think his name was john. :),10
12143,"I would totally recomend the beer, but the tour was too full of people, some costumers at the bar were talking while the guide gave us information and not much of the info was new or interesting. The tour guides were nice but were talking too loud, maybe I haven't enjoyed the style of the tour. ",6
257,"I really enjoyed that the tour tied in the history of the brewery with the production process.  The tour guide was knowledgeable and friendly (I believe it was Mike).  It was also great to try out all the beers, including the yet to be released Liberty IPA (which I enjoyed).  It would have also been great to try out the Barrel Aged offering (the Barleywine); however, I understand that it is limited and you could not have everyone who tours the facility try it and have any left to sell at the end of the day.        I docked a point as there was no discussion of the brewery's barrel program or much discussion on the things to come.     ",9
43868,We had an excellent tour both at the Honda Heritage Center and the factory tour.  We appreciated the customer care that was given at both centers.  The tour guides were excellent.  It was interesting to learn more of the history of the growth and development of Honda in North America.  The factory tour was fascinating!  Thank you for a great tour!!  ,10
42580," This was a great hike because it was challenging and restful at the same time.  The view was excellent. Our guide was knowledgeable, friendly, funny and warm.  He obviously took safety seriously.  The drink on the ride back really hit the spot. ",10
43397,"Very interesting hikes, very knowledgeable and passionate guide.",10
44813,The tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable. It wasn’t just another run of the mill tour of the breeding shed. Not to mention the opportunity to see world class facilities and the top stallions in the game. I’m planning on coming back. ,10
43200,We had a great experience with Six Senses (early bird on 3/30).  Top notch crew who were super friendly.  Paul was very responsive via email and changed up our reservation as requested.  I highly recommend the early bird to beat the crowds.  ,8
55051,"Our guide, Nancy, was very knowledgeable and very friendly. We learned a tremendous amount about the thoroughbred industry which was both fascinating and eye opening. Not only did we tour the farm but we got to see and pet many of the “baby horses” as my daughter in law called the foals. And the stallion was gorgeous. It was the best of the farm tours we’ve been on.",10
124127,"I loved the headset system that was provided to people in the group. It was easy to hear the tour guide without having to stand next  to her the whole time. We were able to look around while still hearing all of the facts. Our tour guide Kelly was also very informative and seemed to love her job, great guide!",10
43557,"We really enjoyed You(Yan?) as a guide. He went at a great pace for us while allowing the rest of the group to keep up as well. He was very knowledgeable in the Flora and fauna of the area, I learned a lot!! The suggestions about activities and places to see in Sayulita were great as well!",8
42906,Seeing a small piece of American history,10
43365,We had a wonderful time. Thanks!,10
42157,John was very knowledgeable and helpful! The top of the mountain had a beautiful view!!,10
42563,Our guide was awesome. His lnowledge and passion for nature was evident and he did such a great job leading the trek and explaining the local flora and fauna. We highly recommend mexi treks!,10

43647,"We had a blast on the Brewmasters tour. Definitely worth the $35. It was so much fun, and we were so impressed with everything we saw. Thank you!",10
44531,never found the guy with our pictures ):,10
28431,"We met Shmuel Browns at Jaffa Gage on time. no problem there. However he didn't have correct information re: our tour. he thought our tour lasted 4-5 hours. when I told him it should be 6 hr tour, he sighed, said Zel didn't tell him that, and he had a preset arrangement. told him to confirm with Zel because I didn't want him to think I was telling him a different story. I didn't want him have bad feelings towards us during the entire tour. after me insisting him to contact Zel, he said he got the info from Zel and it is 6 hr tour. we also had differences on routes as well, visit to Mt. of Olives. again told him I already discussed with Zel re: itinerary. then he sighed again and said we didn't have enough time to go there. towards to the end of the tour, he offered us to go there, but if we did that we didn't have time to visit other places . so we declined.  he was okay, but I wouldn't use him again. we still gave a good tip.",5
44967,"Tour guide was very informative, friendly, and showed us all of the greats at Gainesway. Loved being able to see Tapit and the others. The grounds were beautifully kept, the farm was beautiful, staff was friendly, price was excellent. Will be back!",10
43202,It was cool,10
42907,"It was great to have a tour that talks so much about the history of the farm, horses, and horse racing overall. Beautiful farm with world class stallions. I appreciate the tour guide allowing us to see the horses and take photos with the stallion. It’s one thing to see them from afar but is nice to be able to get up close and personal with them. ",10
44532,Great tour guide! The history of the location and the look and set up was great! The beirtgarden was also a lot of fun!,10
44441,Our guide was outstanding!!,10
43745,We had a very knowledgeable tour guide and had plenty of time to visit with horses and view the stables. We had a wonderful time. ,10
43835,"It was great to see the stallions up close and be able to feed some of them peppermints. I followed those horses during their racing careers, so it's incredible to see them in their paddocks enjoying the next chapter of their lives as stallions.  I loved every minute of my tour and the tour guide, Rodeo, was willing to answer any questions. I would highly recommend this tour to any Thoroughbred racing fan.  Thank you! ",10
44783,"Beautiful farm and I had an up close with Afeet Alex!!!  Love him.  And, I can now say I've met Tapit!!  The young lady inside the office was soooo kind and talked with us like we were family. Horse people in Kentucky are the best!!  I love the traditions, the horses are beautiful and the hospitality is wonderful.",10

45326,Great visitors center and great people working there,10
124148,I like your whiskey so I was kind of taken back by the speed and lack of a personal experience we had.  Everything seemed rushed and the entire experience didn't seem like a brand that takes their time.  It just didn't mesh with what I know about the whiskey.  ,4
44725,My first Bourbon tour was your facility and it was very interesting. Learned a lot and have a new appreciation for the craft. Bo was a great guide and new his stuff.  I would have oved to see the bottling facility in addition to the other areas.,10
41612,Great tour and guide! ,10
43522,Difficult to make reservation via website.  ,10
41776,Great SF and beer history. Historic location. Food truck. Andre was a Wonderful tour guide. ,10
5309,I belong the the Boise Co-Op (Hayden Distributing- Boise ID) and drank regular Anchor Steam and the Christmas Ale for a lot of years after being introduced to the beer in SF during a visit in 1995. The Co-Op was able to obtain the California Lager which I fell in love with. It is my favorite beer. ,10
1608,"Very good tour guide, not too long in length, just right! Beer tasting was great and weren't too strict, they just let us keep drinking... Great tour, really enjoyed it and not expensive either! Thanks again! ",10
1901,"It seemed obvious our tour guide was ""reading a script"" which he did 100s of times, very monotone. Also, kinda sucked that we couldn't do a tour while enjoying a beer, like other breweries allow. It would have been nice to have bigger glasses. I've done many other brewery tours where they will serve you a few pints throughout the tour and the tour cost cheaper than Anchor and the quality is as good or better. Overall, I wasn't impressed and didn't think it was a good value for the amount I paid.  ",5
1958,"Many brewery tours are simply an opportunity to give the same old marketing/advertising - very tiresome. THANK YOU for not following this approach.  This was genuinely informative. In the details of how you brew were several things that were pointed out that differed from other breweries - not better, per-se, but different. As a brewer myself I appreciated that Anchor let thier 'personaltiy' shine through.  Also, I thought it admirable that - instead of being routed AROUND certain areas - that we were ALLOWED access to everything... with the caveat that we were expected to be responsible for our own safety. (It's just 'common sense' but SO many venues deny access because people with NO common sense just-might-be-stupid.) No pictures were allowed because for safety as we needed to keep all of our attention on our environment. What a REFRESHINGLY responsible approach.  (Specifically, regarding the floor housing the secondary fermenters, hoses, centerfuge, etc.)   I'd be glad to return another day.",10
2014,"I'm from the UK and have been a fan on Anchor for a while, since I discovered it in my local shop. I have always wanted to visit the brewery. I have been on many brewery tours in the UK and they always spend a bit too long on the tour of the brewery process but not so much on the history of the brewery and the tasting. I liked that we got to hear about the history of the brewery, none of which I knew about (it's a great story) and they were generous with the tasting. ",10
44819,"The guide we had was great..Very informative, We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!!! Thank You!!!",10
43203,Bo was an excellent tour guide.  The pace of the tour was informative and fun.  Meeting Jimmy Russell and getting a signed bottle was the cherry on top of the sundae!,10
43012,It was a very knowledgeable tour and we learned a lot. It is a beautiful farm. ,10
44917,Great guide and experience in general,10
44862,Very informative tour. Got to see a bit of an actual surgery. ,10
44861,We had so much fun.  We will be back next time.,10
44968,"The tour guide, Bubba, was very engaging and added value to our trip.  ",10
41613,Great staff (jason was amazing on our tour and sooo knowledgeable) and everything was very organized and reliable. Zip lining was also amazing ! Great group to go with ,10
44443,Amazing place!,10
43953,Well ran & informative.  Love the free samples and the low cost of the tour,10
41777,Andru rocks. Food truck accessibility a major plus. Great beer and history. ,10
44795,Our tour guide was excellent!,10
42544,Perfect tour!!.....knowledgeable and friendly tour guide with Olivia. Gorgeous farm!!.....clean!!,10
44777,Great place,10
42909,Friendly staff and very professional tour.,10
44796,"Excellent tour as was the information the guide provided us.  Then again, it was really about seeing Tapit anyway,  but the breeding details, history and operation of the farm was much appreciated.  I'll be visiting again in the fall.",10
43523,"John was very knowledgeable it helped he has worked there for 10 years, funny and entertaining. It was a great tour. Thank you John. ",10
44879,IAN TAPP gave us a very nice tour of the stallion barn. Very personable and polite. You could tell he was passionate about his job and the horses. It's very nice that Gainsway takes time to give horse racing enthusiasts a glimpse of life beside your gates. I also wants to thank you for taking the extra effort to participate in FoalPatrol. Love it!!!!! Keep up the good work. !!! Jacki G.,10
45141,"Nancy was terrific and helped this non-horse person understand the beauty and grace of thoroughbred country.  From a one week old foal to yearlings to mares ready deliver, it was a great visit. And the descriptions of the care that goes into their care was fascinating.  A great visit. Thanks",10
44798,"Horses were great, the guide was great and very informative. Area was just gorgeous - a lot of work to maintain but it shows like a postcard! Awesome!",10
44928,"Everything about the tour was enjoyable. The staff is very pleasant, our tour guide was entertaining and knowledgeable (I wish I could remember her name, but alas it's not coming to me - I believe it started with an M and she was not feeling 100% that day) but nonetheless provided a very enjoyable tour and was willing and able to answer any questions asked of her. The tasting at the end of the tour was also informative and enjoyable. My only recommendation would be is with regards to your T-shirt selections. I am always looking for a shirt that, in this case, would have a small Wild Turkey logo about the size of a breast pocket on the front and a large depiction of something related to Wild Turkey on the back. Unfortunately I was not able to find that style of shirt. (I had one from a visit from about 20 years ago, but it has met its demise several  years ago....was hoping to replace it. But I digress - the tour was great and all the people we encountered were very pleasant.",10
44320,Great experience. Tour was just the right,8
45019,"I’ve already recommended you to someone I met. You’re very responsive to questions. Nice tour guide, good energy was abundant! ",10
45139,"ONLY SAW A FEW HORSES, WAY OFF IN THE PADDOCKS.  EMPTY STALLS AND STRAW ARE NOT INTERESTING.....",5
45150,The walking tour was absolutely amazing. Having Price Ball as our tour guide made the experience truly unique. To heat the history of his family’s farm was great. I took my two daughters on the tour with me and they were allowed to get up close with the horses and the foals. Truly amazing and special experience for them. This was our first time in Kentucky for 2 horse loving girls and they have learned so much while having a great time with the horses. ,10
44634,Nice facility. Really good tour by Heather.  This was our fourth tour of a bourbon distillery in the past week and this was by far the most informative. ,10
44034,We like seeing and knowing the transition of the thoroughbred to other adaptable careers. Appreciate the work this team is doing for the horses.,10
42758,I learned a lot! They are very knowledgeable and nice.  They answer all your questions and are eager to show everyone what they do at the center.,10
44863,Staff were friendly and knowledgeable. We really enjoyed learning about the history ,10
41614,"Liz did a great job leading the tour, very knowledgeable, great personality.",10
43954,Wonderful tour and tour guide!  The horses were fantastic!!!  Absolutely beautiful farm!,10
2327,"We just attended the Ales of Antiquity dinner. We love the beer, the food, the history behind the beer, & the people are awesome! The food for yesterday's dinner was so amazing. I would love if an option like that could be available on the regular menu - even if only as a monthly or weekly special, or even on a slower day. The common beers were sooooo good & I much prefered them to the carbonated versions which are on tap right now. ",10
1983,"Beer, Food and Service was Awesome!",10
3031,"The guide was great and very informative, easy going and made a fun atmosphere. I definitely liked the fact that not only was the brewing process talked about but he also dove further into beer itself and the history behind it. Between learning the five ways of smelling to reasons behind choosing a can over glass bottle it was a superb tour!",10
2267,"Great tour, loved the tour guide and the fun sampling at the end.   Unfortunately I think about half the group couldn't hear the guide at any given time. Not her fault, it was just way, way too noisy. A lot of people lost interest, and I think I'd only bring people who already liked beer in the future. ",9
2773,"There is truly something magical about Avery Brewing Co.  The staff are extraordinarily knowledgable, the service is lightening-speed, and the food is some of the best in the region.  You can tell immediately that every employee loves their job, and that feeling is contagious as a guest.  The free tour was interesting and very thorough, and also included a free taster of their famous Hog's Heaven.  I'm normally one to run at the sight of an IPA, but Hog's Heaven is the first one I've tried that I've actually enjoyed.  Thank you, Avery Brewing Co., for a wonderful and memorable evening!",10
3024,The bourbkin is the best beer I have ever had. The tour guide was excellent. I do wish the tour was longer because I'd like to learn all the details. :),10
4479,"The grade refers to the tour not the beer :) It was INCREDIBLY loud, and not only because of the machinery but because of extremely loud music downstairs (I understand that they like listening to music while working, I do it too but it's be nice for it to be off during the tour so people can actually hear). As for the brewery noises, I understand those cannot be taken care of but you might think about using a microphone like they do in other facilities where I have been. Also, we do not need to be inside for the first 10 minutes or so when the guide talks about the history of the place and of beer so we could easily have the introductory part outside the noisy zone where it is quieter and easier to understand.",5
7949,"I tour was not very exciting and there wasn't really any tasters until the end. New Belgium's tour was a 10/10 and your was 4/10, but the tour guide was really nice and knowledgeable! ",6
8488,"I have and will continue to recommend Avery to my friends and family always. I will say however, this is the first time I went on the brewery tour and there was no tasting or offering of any kind of any of your beers....? And when the tour was done (which was next to impossible to hear the tour guide even when asked to speak up) we went to ask for a taste or two from the bar and even with the stamp from the tour, the bar tender was quite quip and even kurt or rude about giving us the two samples we asked to taste (what happened to getting tiny tastes at Avery with kindness....?). I still love Avery and will continue to eat and drink here......oh and one last detail: When we went from drinking outside downstairs to eating upstairs, the open bill did not transfer upstairs and we almost left without closing that tab out because it ended up somehow being separate....? Wondering how that might be more smoothly transferred with the customer upstairs etc....? Thanks and keep making and pouring clean and delicious beers!!!",5
42545,Tom was great!,10
44072,"Jade are a very professional firm. Our family enjoyed the guided tour of M.A. National Park very much. We saw lots of wildlife, got some great photos and also learn't so much from our friendly and knowledgable guide Francisco.",10
43368,"We took the Brewmasters Tour on Tuesday, March 27th @10am with eight other people.  Our guide was fabulous.  We were shown some of the inside workings of the Bud plant, in an intimate setting.  All our questions were answered, the tour was well worth the price.",10
43748,Tasting experience lacked professionalism experienced at other distilleries.,2
44162,"Access to all the mares and foals. There were so many to see in the smaller paddocks. One boy who had a ""step mom"" was willing to come over and visit with us.  He was very brave.  In the barn there were several  1-2 day old babies and they were adorable. Good photo ops.  Also I wouldn't mind living in the guest cottage. That was beautiful! ",10
44537,Bo was very knowledgeable ,9
44563,the history of the farm. big fan of the phipps and janney horses and many of them stand at claiborne and all of those who stood there in the past. john gave excellent tour,10
44864,Very informative. Great tour guide!,10
44779,Great guide & Tapit,10
42368,"We highly recommend the Stevens Point Brewery tour in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. They actually know how to make beer. Sorry. ",2
45046,"We prepaid our reservation and booked in advance, given the size of our party.  However, Saturday morning - we woke up to snow/icy conditions from unexpected wintry weather in Lexington.  I've visited Wild Turkey twice before and I'm aware of the bridge, the winding roads, and where its located.  Our reservation was at 10am and I called 3 times between 9:15am and 10:30am to find out the status of the distillery, let them know we were running late, and to find out our options: my call was never answered and I left a voicemail on the first call and did not receive a callback.  Our group decided to wait slightly for conditions to improve and arrived at the distillery around 11am (since we also couldn't even confirm it was open since no one answered the phone) and were given the option of switching to the tasting since we'd missed our 10am reservation and ya'll were booked for the day.  I requested a refund in the price difference since no one answered any of my phone calls.  It was frustrating to arrive then see 5 employees at the front desk (3 of who were simply chatting with each other), yet be told that everyone was so busy to answer the phone.  Even though the bourbon was delicious, the experience left a sour taste in our mouth that we couldn't get refunded the price difference.  I reached out to the tasting room managers, Courtney & Tyler, and have not received a reply in the past 4 days.  Won't be returning to, recommending, or continuing to purchase Wild Turkey (and that probably goes for the rest of our group of 13).  Sorry!",0
45143,The tour was more than a tour of a Horse Farm🐎‼️ It was a history lesson into Kentucky’s Thoroughbred development & the people & families that have created this rich & wonderful Lexington Tradition ‼️Thank you to our teacher(She was the best ) ‼️ She was so much more than a tour guide‼️ Her love & pride of this farm (family) allowed us the opportunity to learn & almost feel we were apart of the Thoroughbred Industry 👍 I didn’t feel like I was on a tour but more like a client being exposed to this farms superlative operation🐎‼️ I’m SOLD‼️,10
44163,"Our host was super nice & answered all our questions. Also, we had great access to the Stallions and that made it a better experience than other tours I have been on",10
42250,Other brewery tours I've been on were more of an immersive experience - the tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable but I wish there were more visuals to show the whole process and make it more interesting. It seemed kind of like a boring lecture ,3
44931,Our tour guide (Jami) on the Beer Master tour was fantastic.  Loved the beautiful Clydesdales!  Great way to spend a day in St. Louis.,10
44820,"The gentleman that gave the tour was very knowledgeable & I love that we got to see all of the stallions, even if they were in their stalls.",10
43682,"My son and I had a great time.  The tour was very informative and we learned alot.  The tour guide was very nice.  I can't remember his name, but he did the 12:10pm Bud Light Tour on April 2nd.  Everyone was so nice.",10
45068,1. The tour was great.  I had never been to a distillery before.  I was on the 3pm tour on 4/10.  Do not remember the tour guides name but she was very good. 2. The tasting was excellent.  i only began drinking bourbon about 6 months ago and n ever had any of your products.  Based on the tasting i bought Russell's Single Barrel and american Honey which my wife liked. 3. I met Jimmy Russell and he signed my two bottles.  learned a lot about Bourbon.,10
45186,We had great guides and we got plenty of time to see CA Chrome and then rest of the stallions.  All of the staff was very knowledgeable and very friendly. ,10
44003,"Our tour of Claiborne Farm was excellent. Since our guide, Joe, is directly involved in the breeding process, he was a wealth of information regarding the history of the farm, how the breeding operation occurs, and most importantly the story of all the stallions (past and present) at Claiborne. Joe brought out Orb, War Front and Blame for the group the take pictures of and pose with. It was amazing just to be able to stand next to these incredible animals. I would highly recommend this experience to anyone interested in touring Claiborne. ",10
45032,"Beautiful grounds, well-informed staff, very informative tour.",10
45264,We loved seeing American Pharoah!,10
43370,Excellent guide and spirits ,10
44812,"Very personal, loved the small group size and ability to see the workings of the hospital. Gave my daughter a good view of what a horse vet job would look like. ",10
41780,Was great just wish the merchandise wasn’t so pricey,8
43209,"Our tour guide was super friendly (I don’t remember her name-we were the 4 pm tour on Saturday, 3/31). We had our 5 month old with us and she was very sweet with him even though we know it was a little strange having a baby on a bourbon tour! But she made us feel just like we belonged! So it was very appreciated! ",10
41233,Bubby was a great tour guide to start.  The history and the tour of the grounds were very educational to learn why Bourbon is made in KY. ,10
44323,The tour guide was committed to excellence in every regard. Great embassador for Anchor. ,10
43653,Working at a bourbon distillery and found it very interesting touring the brewery and how my favorite beer is made. I really enjoyed it. ,10
44810,"We got to see the ""big"" stallions outside and also saw some nice mares and foals so got a bit of the entire farm experience.",9
44445,Entertaining guide. Well-packed with technical info but well-balanced with humor. ,9
43877,"The rickshaw-man was very friendly, helpful and of course, very hot, as well. In addition, we had the privilege of enjoying the splendour of a section of Arashiyama Bamboo Grove that wasn't teeming with tourists!",10
43956,Enjoyed our visit on Thursday morning.  Very nice tour and our guide did an excellent job.  Only her second day doing solo tours but she was very pleasant and knowledgeable.  ,9
44990,Very interesting to see the history of brewing in St. Louis and the incredible process. Tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. Loved the samples of beer and the atmosphere was very clean and professional! ,10
44731,Great tour 👍🏼,10
44164,My favorite rum for many years. Great tour!,10
45131,"This was our third visit to the farm and it was the best! The California Chrome Experience is a fantastic opportunity to see him and get a great appreciation for the farm and what a thoroughbred opetstion is really like. I think it's very generous to make this available to fans and feel it was a well-balanced tour with plenty of time to see (and photograph) Chrome as well as some of the other horses too.  It is especially nice to see the broodmares and foals -- who can resist those gorgeous babies?!   We're glad to see that the gift shop has been expanded and wrapping up the visit with Daddy Joe's for the included lunch made this one of the best tours we've done with Horse Country.  We also lucked out with the weather; while a little cold, the sun was shining the whole time -- unlike the next two days where it was not so nice ! ",10
45048,Our tour guide was fantastic. She was so friendly and informative. The staff were so accommodating... so tolerant of a tour group during their most busy time of the year. We will definitely be back for another visit. ,10
44867,Very organized and informative tour,10
44805,We loved the tour.  Got some really good information about your clinic.  We were so happy that we attended this tour.  We would highly recommend it to others.  ,10
45291,Tour was very informative. Guide did a very good job.,10
44165,Very good info and tasting. ,10
42369,Wonderful tour- enjoyed seeing the different Fallas & appreciated the VIP experience for one of the special section Fallas.   Loved seeing the local Falla house and getting the tour from one of the members including explanation of the Fallas.   (only glitch was timing of meeting the local Falla member but his tour made the wait worth it).   Mascleta was crazy crowded and our view point was somewhat obstructed but we would have had to arrive much earlier to get a closer viewing spot.   Still fantastic sites and sounds of mascleta.   Thank you for a great tour!!!,9
43526,Awesome time! Thanks,10
43752,"Mike, the tour guide, was great. He was informative and personable. Give that guy a raise! ",10
43959,"The tour shown us a 100% real production operation, nothing fake, very impressive in seeing individual motionless parts magically integrated into lively shiny quality automobiles shooting off from the final assembly.  One suggestion, as a way to promote participation, ask the attendees what they believe would happen if self-driving car becomes affordable - e.g. will they rent-on-demand or plan to own one?",10
45009,Wanted to see the foals,9
44543,The hole thing was great. We had a grate guide and learned a lot. Just so much fun. ,10
45025,BUBBA!!!!!,10
45038,Our tour guide was a lovely young women currently interning in the marketing area. I can’t remember her name but she was amazing! I can’t believe how much information she shared on each horse and could point horses out on the tour. I took my 2 girls ages 14 and 9 on the tour and they had an amazing time. This was our first horse farm tour and time visiting Kentucky and we were so happy to have winstar kick off our great trip. ,10
44985,The English lady that gave us a tour was very nice and knowledgeable about the stallions.  She was an excellent tour guide.  The grounds and facilities are gorgeous.  We felt welcomed and the students loved seeing American Pharoah.,10
44446,"Pretty sure her name was Sam.  She was our tasting and tour guide.  A delightful mix of sass, sarcasm, wit, and customer service.",10
44877,John the groom who lead our tour. He was very knowledgeable and friendly! It was wonderful to see so many beautiful champion horses and learn their history. Beautiful farm and friendly staff.,10
44881,"guide was extremely knowledgable; enjoyed seeing the stallions; wish I could have seen some mares & foals--actually, I am the kind though who would have loved to have seen every horse on the farm",9
44784,Great opportunity  to tour the grounds and meet the legendary stallions. Enjoyed seeing the barns up close- the iron work and slate name plates. Ian was a great tour guide. Glad that you have people actively involved with the farm and breeding operation giving tours.  ,10
45010,It was a great experience and the lady did a great job me and my family really enjoyed it,10
44978,"Unfortunately, we did not have time for a tour but could do a tasting.  Many distilleries do not allow this  Wild Turkey did.  And it was free for my husband as he is an ex-marine.  They were very nice to us even though we didn't take the tour.  Would recommend.",10
44363,I consider 8 a very positive rating. Would only rate higher if you were in a more interesting historic building. The new metal building is blah but your setup inside is good. ,8
44717,Great time! ,9
45084,Staff was very friendly and all was so well organized. What a great experience ! ,10
43960,"A unique experience, we learned a lot about the area, our driver (Kengo) was fun and friendly and a great photographer. One of our favourite experiences in Japan and we came away with great memories!",10
44638,Group size was perfect and we didn’t feel rushed.  Being able to be close to the horses and understand the farm’s role was great.  Thank you so much for sharing with us!,10
41846,"The tour guide was very knowledgeable, he knew the history inside out and had a good way of telling it. The history around the buildings and the inside access we received was incredible.",10
42370,Loved it!,10
44734,"Tons of cool information. Ben, our guide, was spot on perfect...and the beer was mighty fine!",10
42550,"The tour was one of my favorites on the bourbon trail, and the tastings were surprisingly good and different from one another.",10
44888,"Nice and happy people, all fun!",10
21656,"Our hostess knew a lot of info about Steamwhistle.  It was just kind of a yawn.  The samples were nice but it wasn't that interactive and it had a ""frat"" feel.  Most of the group was tourists - so I think we expected more historical info, and more of a what makes steamwhistle awesome and more visuals.  Having a few staff be dedicated hosts or hostess' would prob make the experience better.  Also, maybe a paper handout that shows what's happening behind all the metal.  More actual samples or something.  I paid $24 for me and another and we each had 1 beer.  So it felt lame. ",4
43527,Amazing experience and nice people!,10
45070,"Felt welcome and got to see great stallions. Of course, Tapit was the highlight, but I loved Birdsong’s looks. ",10
43655,The tour was rushed and it was very difficult to hear the docent. The docent was new and needed to polish her presentation.  ,3
204657,"Jacob did a fantastic job providing us with  some interesting history about 3 Fired Guys. Some good laughs, a fascinating tour and now my new favourite beer! Love everything about Steam Whistle!",10
44076,"Great experience and beautiful farm. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable in the pedigrees, current and past race horse history!!! We were impressed with his knowledge and he truly was proud of Claiborne farm!! ",10
44869,"Every single employee that we encountered during our visit and tour of The Budweiser Brewery on Sunday, April 8th was friendly, courteous, helpful, informative, knowledgeable, and professional.  We had a wonderful time and a tasty lunch.  But, most importantly, you converted me, a lifelong beer hater,  to a lover of your new Wild Blue and also the Bud Lite Orange.  I only wish I could find it here at home in Florida.  Please ship some our way at your earliest opportunity.  We loved our time in St. Louis and hope to be able to visit again sometime and visit The Warm Springs Ranch and Grant's Farm.  Thank you.        Sincerely, Pamela Irvin",10
44935,Enjoyed the tour. The location was just beautiful and the whiskey was delicious. ,10

44906,Tour was great and the stallions are beautiful. It was a knowledgeable tour as well.,10
43754,"We paid for 5 tickets to the museum but we’re only allowed to browse for 10 mins. If it wasn’t for that, we would have rated it a 10",8
44449,"No Dalmatians and Clydesdales few and hard to see, or it would have been a 10. ",9
41848,Jeff was a great tour guide very tentative and knowledgeable. The tour itself was amazing very cool to see where all my beer comes from and to see how it was made. Overall no complaints just a great experience. Oh group sizes we're perfect too not to big I was impressed that you didn't cram alot of people into one tour!!!,10
42371,Paid extra to see canning and bottling above the free tour and was not running. Wasn’t worth the extra money. ,6
44972,Phenomenal tour. Ian taught me SOO much! The farm is magical... the stallions!! Seeing the mare and foal right away was incredibly special. Love it there!,10

115343,The farm is historic but the lack of pristine maintenance was surprising -- looked like the farm in the 1950s.  E.g. lots of debris on the roof of visitors center.  ,7
44872,Meeting the stallions and getting open and direct information from Michael on the farm operations and the breeding program. It’s a beautiful setting.,10
44937,"Gainesway is so beautiful!  Everyone should see that farm.  The highlight, of course, was seeing Tapit. The stallion caregivers were so friendly and accommodating. If I had one ""letdown"", it was that we could not touch the horses.  Even just a rub on the shoulder or a picture taken with the horse would be so appreciated.  But - I understand.  He and the other stallions are so valuable and no chances can be taken.  Thank you Gainesway!",10
115646,The farm and staff are very humble and welcoming.  They made it feel like home even though this is a multi-million dollar operation.  Thanks for representing Kentucky and the industry so well!,10

45169,"Was looking forward to kayak tour but instead was switched to boat tour, which was exactly not what I wanted.  Rather have no tour than boat tour bc we prefer to be actively doing something than doing a passive activity.  Even if it's just padding 100 meters and back, we'll be happy with that.  We've been on boat tours before, I know my kids and myself, boat tour are just not for us.",5

The tour was well worth the money, enjoyed beer throughout the entire tour, we received free hats, a glass cup and the discount for the gift shop, plus learning all about the making of the beer. All the picture opportunities and seeing the Clydesdale's made the tour even better. Highly satisfied with everything and very likely to return with friends to tour again!  ",10

43217,The total experience. Keep up the good work. Don’t change a thing. ,10
43135,I think the free tour is well worth it. I do not feel the museum tour was not worth 15 dollars dspecially since the other tours are less. ,8
43121,Our tour guide Kayla is the reason we had Great time and would recommend everyone in St Louis to take the tour. We’ve lived here our whole lives as 45-50 year olds and had never been to the brewery. Advice would be to have an entrance or view of the tour and Biergarten area visible from the highway. ,10
42710,"We did have a great time but, I want to let you know that my very first contact with AB personnel was far from great. Inasmuch as I had made reservations for my family weeks in advance, I went straight to the check-in line for guests with existing reservations. Despite the rainy weather (March 29), there were a considerable number of people waiting to check in or buy tickets. There were 2 employees at the counter; a tall, slender young man with a courteous and kind demeanor and a woman with a medium-build and brunette ponytail. Eventually, I was greeted with “do you have a reservation?” The rest of the conversation went much like this. “Yes”.  “Which tour?” “2pm.” “But which tour?” “I didn’t notice that there was more than 1 choice at 2pm, but I have your confirmation email right here. Will that help?” “What will help is if I know which tour.” Apparently, she was able to glean the info she needed from my confirmation email and we were unceremoniously sent on our way to wait patiently. Abrupt, disinterested and downright disrespectful would be my overall first impression of my AB experience.",9
42583,Very informative.  Polite staff,10
43080,Our tour guide was very informative! And it was a good time ,10
43099,"The head phones didn't work one other person and me walked with the group not hearing anything.should of asked for money back.This is'nt Anheuser standards.other people in other groups said they didn't have head phones.Anheuser still does alot for its community you do need to get head phones,thanks for asking.",7
42593,"The hospitality was great. The tour guides were very knowledgeable and friendly. Obviously, the free beer was a great bonus.  ",10
42949,"The tour was just ok. I rated it a 7 because our tour guide was awesome! She was so knowledgeable and really personalized the experience. The escalator was broken, the packing machines had stopped working and my family didn’t get the full experience.",7
45246,A fantastic experience with an abundance of tastes to indulge in. Celia was also the perfect guide and hostess. ,10
36748,I only gave this 5 out if 10 because I’m a little disappointed in the tour. I had taken it last year in August as well and it was definitely a longer tour then. I get that you’re expanding and moving things to another location (which is fantastic because I’m a big fan) but why have the shortened version of the tour? It just doesn’t do the brewery justice in my opinion ,5
42817,The tour guides were very informative and the tour highlighted the history and making of Budweiser. We enjoyed 2 samples on the tour which was great because it was a complimentary tour! I would definitely recommend it to friends. ,10
43131,Not very informative on the beer brewing process. The museum and tour guide did not give enough information about the family or real history about this brewery.  ,1
44082,"We had made reservations for a tour time and arrived ahead of time and were easily able to change our reservations to the next available tour.  We appreciated that flexibility. Our tour guide was pleasant, positive, and informative.",8

1876,"The best transportion service ever!! Very professional, prompt and courtesy at all times. Totally recommend them. Also, prices for our large group of 60 people was very affordable.",10
5407,Raphael was a great driver. He was very easy to converse with and provided a lot of history about Panama and the culture of the island. He was a great guy and would certainly request him on another visit to Panama. ,10
19533,"The first driver was an excellent speaker (with very good English and deep knowledge of history of Panama). It was a very pleasant and informative trip. The second driver didn't speak English, unfortunately, but anyway was friendly and helpful.",9

Hands down how great it was and the amount of knowledge your guide had about your brewery! Love your beer and even more intrigued with your brewery and history! Thanks for a great experience!,10
42556,educational,10
44550,"We absolutely LOVE visiting the Darley stallions! From the moment you step into the reception lobby, you know you're in a special place. You get a great ""feel"" for luxurious setting these horses and humans get to call home.  The tours are conducted by people who obviously love their work and take pride in showing off the farm to visitors.  We appreciate that you've opened your doors to both breeders/owners and the casual fans.  I do not take for granted the generosity of the time and attention given to us by the staff.  Seeing these horses is, of course, the highlight of the tour. I could stay there a week and not get tired of seeing the day to day operation and a round-the-clock view of how the horses spend their time.... !  Thank you so much for allowing us the opportunity to visit -- we'll certainly be back again  (p.s.  thanks also for the stallion hats -- I'm adding to my collection with each visit ! ) ",10
30406,"Great tour guide, great beer",10
43661,"The one thing that is missing is that i couldnt know more because of the language. It nobody's fault. The driver want to explain more, tell stories, but because my japanese is limited and his english is limited, it becomes extermely difficult. But he gave his best. Very professional and full of smiles. Was a different feeling than walking.",9
44555,"I was blown away by the fact that the tour was free and still only $5 if you reserve online. I thought it was very informative and fun, especially if you’re a beer fan. My only complaint is that the guides were hard to hear at some points (audio speakers by horses very quiet, guide mumbling sometimes).",7
44454,Very informative tour. Great facility. Bubba was a great tour guide. ,10

42170,Bubba really made the tour a fun time.  He really did a super job at the tasting!!  He was fun and very informative.  He was enthusiastic and he really loves what he does.  You don't see that much anymore.   He was really proud of Wild Turkey and I picked up 2 bottles on the way out.   I don't think I'd have done that with anyone else.   Had a great time and can't wait to come back. ,10
41854,Our tour guide Alison was the best! We had such a great time. ,10

43760,Great. ,10
43968,"We had an excellent time on the Ghorepani/Poonhill trek. It was unlike anything we had done before and we feel very proud for having made it from the start to the end having enjoyed every moment.  Our porter (Dawson) was excellent. Although it was his first trip as a porter, his customer service was perfect. We had many laughs with him, we spoke about Nepalese and British culture, we played cards during the evenings and found it really easy to get along with him. He has clearly gained outstanding customer service skills through other jobs that he has had and these were transferred into his new role as a porter. He will make an excellent guide and I would highly recommend him to many of our friends. Mohan, our guide was very nice. However, we did feel that at times he found it very hard to relax. It was harder to speak with him and have a good laugh Ashe was more concerned with getting us from A-B than having fun along the way. Although we did get along with him okay, we found it hard to find any common ground with him and at times this made for quite awkward exchanges. Nonetheless, we still have an amazing time and we’re very happy with the outcome of the trip. ",8
42264,people were so nice!!!,10

42560,"Entire staff at the brewery was helpful, efficient, very friendly, and appeared to like, end even, enjoy working there.  The young woman who introduced the tour could not be heard by the large group, and was either unable or unwilling to speak louder.  That was disappointing.  Everyone on thought the young man who presented the tour (Wednesday, 04/28/18 -- 10:45 AM) did a great job.",9

Since he is so special, this was really great.  Plus getting a photo doing it was perfect!  The tour was all great. We had lots of time to see the mares and foals and the tour guides ere really friendly and seemed to enjoy doing the tours.  And the food was really good too!  Just a perfect afternoon!  We would do it all again!",10
44459,"We really enjoyed the tour. We thought the tour guide (Sorry forgot his name) was fantastic and very knowledgeable. The tasting session at the end was great fun and a good setting to further quiz the tour guide! I would say the size of the tour group is maybe a bit big for the locations within the brewery. At some of the stops we struggled to hear what was being said by the guide. This could be improved by either speaking louder, reducing group size or picking better locations to stop and talk! I also enjoyed the gift shop and thought it was very good value for money.",10

44804,The person giving The tour was one of the most intelligent and knowledgeable people we have ever had give a tour. He truly cared and understood this was a once in a lifetime experience for most of us. He took extra time to show us a mare and foal as a special treat. They took 4 studs out for us so we could get incredible pictures. Even though it was close to mares arriving for breeding. They made sure we still got to see them. Then on top of it we got to go in the barn and see more stallions. Awesome tour. The only thing I would do different is to spend less time in the breeding shed. He was great explaining all that and for folks that haven't seen that I'm sure it was great. It's just once you have been to one breeding shed you really don't to spend time in another. Truly one of the best tours we have ever been on.  ,9

15592,"We've already recommended it to people we met on the trip.  The Beerwmaster tour was unlike any other we have taken.  Living close to Merrimack, NH and visiting Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, we had already taken the general tour and Beer School.  Getting behind the scenes, understanding the bottling, the labeling, the quality control portions and actually tasting the product along the way was phenomenal.  We loved the historical portion, and nothing compares to seeing the horses in the stables.  (Glad we got to Grant Farm to see them there, too.)  Questions were answered.  It was a great learning experience, but it was fun, engaging and friendly.  Who could ask for more?",10

18472,I’ve been on the regular tour and this one is MUCH BETTER! Of course that could have just been due to our tour guide. She really had all the knowledge about the brewery and company. I don’t think there was a question she was asked that she didn’t know the answer to. She is a BIG reason I want to bring others back to do the tour again.

12395,The tour was very extensive and we saw most of the brewery production cycle which was what I hoped for.,10
12770,Our tour guide was great.  We went on the same tour last year during the 4th holiday also.  We thought our tour guide from last year would be hard to beat but this guy did a fantastic job and we enjoyed as much or more than last year.

There were no drawn out silent times. He was continuously feeding us with information on the brewery, the history, various facts about the area, and always added a bit of humor. This was an Anniversary and birthday present for my husband and he was so impressed. Thank you for a wonderful experience and training your tour guides to fill them with a rich knowledge of the history of A-B.  We will definitely be returning when we are in St Louis again. ",10

After our first stop at the outdoor corral I asked our guide to speak a bit more slowly (enunciating more clearly would have helped as well) but she and the other guide kept up their fast pace throughout the tour.  Having had such difficulty understanding as a native American English-speaker, I can only imagine how little the foreigners on our tour understood.  This difficulty significantly marred my overall enjoyment of the tour.",8

12983,"The Day Fresh Tour was a perfect length - plenty of sightseeing - Tour guides were Great!!!  However, the availability of seating space was not very good.  The organization of what to do at end of tour was not well defined.  We just took Uber back to the hotel.",10
13000,The tour was so much fun and very informative. We loved all the beer samples and free goodies. Our tour gunder I believe Anni was her name was awesome! ,10

18254,Great tour. Bud people are well trained.,10
13312,Great tour guide!! ,10
13052,Overall good experience.  Guides did a nice job.  In some of the areas I might be good to show a short video to get a better visual of the steps being completed.  Example in the bottling area.  The exhaust from the grill when you approach the entrance was a bit annoying.  It seemed to hang in the air.  On a hot day it would be nice if this smoke was pushed up and away from the garden area.  Not sure why the building would have been designed with it coming out the side so close to the ground.  Trolly truck could also use some attention.  Cosmetically rough in some areas and a/c didn't seem to be working.,8
12375,Everything was great.,10
12639,The tour guides were hilarious and the facility was beautiful. Our 4 year loved the Clydesdale horses.,10
12570,"The tour was excellent.  The guide, Claire, was knowledgeable and presented the history with confidence. We thoroughly enjoyed the brewmaster experience and definitely enjoyed sampling the beer. Seeing the Clydesdales in the paddocks was a highlight of the tour. ",10

18793,Our tour guide was great,10
15403,"We had a very enjoyable experience at the Brewmaster Tour on Saturday, 7/22/17, the excessive heat of the day notwithstanding. Our tour guide Prince was fun, funny, and informative, though he spoke a bit too quickly at times to understand all that he was saying. Thoroughly enjoyed touring the AB campus and learning the history of the founders and the brands(s). The new trolleys were fun to ride on and getting to taste ""day fresh"" Bud was a treat! I would definitely recommend the tour to others, I just don't give perfect scores!",8
13004,"We took the museum tour; there were only 4 of us in the tour which made it an awesome, personal experience. The history included in the tour was our favorite thing about it....aside from the free booze of course. :]",10
12150,It was a great tour. Our guide was great. We learned a lot and really enjoyed ourselves. ,10
12662,"Tour guides need improvement. I've done the free and Day Fresh tours and my only complaint both times has been the tour guides. They're nice enough people, but they barely volunteer any information that isn't scripted into each stop on the tour. One example would be when we went to the packaging facility and I noticed a huge statue of a fox on the side of the building. I was curious what the significance was and had to ask. The tour guide knew a lot about it, but if I hadn't have asked no one would have known about the cereal they made there during the prohibition and how the fox was its mascot. I feel like a great tour would have tour guides that throw out lesser known facts instead of reciting lines about the process - which I could probably read about online if I wanted to. ",5
12199,"Our tour guide was outstanding! He was very knowledgeable, entertaining and friendly. I would highly recommend paying the money for this tour. ",10
12645,Very interesting and the campus is beautiful. We loved seeing the horses as well!,10

15012,Our tour was great and so was our Tour guide (sorry forgot his name).  Everyone seemed friendly and we were given a lot of info!  My husband is a bud guy so we would definitely visit again!,10

15718,It was an incredible experience. Everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable. That was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. I've been on brewery tours before for other companies and this is by leaps and bounds the best tour I've ever been on. ,10

12650,It was an amazing and beautiful tour.  I was highly impressed with how clean and neat the grounds were and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Thanks for a wonderful trip!,10
14339,Great event with great food. It's too bad that you provide everyone with 4 full size beers. There is so much waste because of all of the food served also. ,10
16262,"Loved it, one of the best times I've had",10
13436,Our tour guide was great.  She was knowledgeable and made the experience fun.  We liked the head phones which made it easy to hear everything that was said.  Thanks for a great tour.,10
13888,"Our tour guide was EXCELLENT! I bought the tour for my husband. We are on vacation and have our two teenage daughters with us. I expected they would be bored, but tolerant. They both had a great time and agreed it was all because we had such a wonderful tour guide. My husband and I loved it as well. We took the free tour a few years back and both felt the Beer Master tour was worth the extra money! We had a great day!",10
12648,"Fun day trip!  Good food, very friendly and knowledgeable employees, and immaculate campus.  I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting St Louis!",10

13618,"Not only was the tour itself great, our tour guide was fantastic! She kept us engaged and was very entertaining. Along with the great experience during the tour we were one of the selected tour groups to attended the Thomas Rhett concert. Overall, 10/10 would recommend the tour to anyone I can. ",10
12911,Learning about the brewery history and the the beer making process was fascinating.  Additionally the tour guides were very knowledgeable and provided amusement during the tour ,10
14041,"We just so enjoyed the tour, we learned a lot, our tour guide was AWESOME.  We were really impressed by everything.  ",10
12913,"The 2 gals who did our tour were informative and fun and kept the tour moving on a hot day. Paying for the day fresh tour was worth it to skip the line on a holiday weekend with a baby in tow. The samples were great! Kind of sad we only got one beer at the end, but the remodel since I had been there in the past looked great! ",10
20552,"Guide was excellent, and so friendly and helpful. Clydesdale handlers were so congenial and friendly with my group's participants. They answered many questions for the group and were so patient.  Could not have been a better experience!",10

19598,Our tour guide was great. Loved the smaller size group and the samples we were given. It was nice to be able to try a few types that I normally wouldn't have. Loved the fact that we were able to see the packing in operation.,10

14456,"This was my 2nd time on the Beer Master tour, purchased this visit as a birthday present for my brother. Our entire group loved it, and I would totally do it again with friends. Kim our tour guid was amazing!! Very interactive.  Thanks again!!",10
19620,The site was extremely beautiful for a plant.  The story tell during the tour is so informative and impressive.  This tour is worth the price without a doubt!,10
12847,Love the historical side of the tour. Free beer is always a plus ,10

12655,"Friendly staff, great tours with free things.",10
12991,"For starters, we were 3-4 minutes late getting to the tour, but called ahead. When we got there, with our 13 month old, one of the guides waited back for us and caught us up. That meant a lot. The rest of the tour was fun and felt more personalized from that moment on. ",10
13074,"Fun, interesting, informative, great tour guides, love the dames and the fresh beer sample made the day we toured",10
12746,Cool to see the history and the process,10
13184,One of the tour guides spoke to fast making it very difficult to understand her. ,8
12862,Fun fun fun fun fun fun,10
12925,"The tour was great for a few reasons, guide was informative and outgoing, the tour of the facilities was awesome, the samples of beer was great but to see the Clydesdales and the housing was the best part.  ",10
13023,"The tour covered lots of different parts of the campus and the brewing process. It was through and fun! We had two tour guides, one who seemed very good with people and knew well beyond the ""script"" of the tour. Our other guide, while maybe newer, had trouble answering a few questions, spoke too quickly to understand and presented as if she were just doing the tour for the millionth time and couldn't wait for it to be over. This didn't ruin our experience at all, but a more genuine and relaxed pace would have been nice. ",10
13505,It was a great way to learn about the brewery process and actually see it in action. Awesome that it was made fun for the kids too! ,9
13002,"I am so glad you asked. I was on the 12:10 Day Fresh Tour. If making friends is your business, you did not make friends with myself and my guests. The tour guides were bored and did not represent Budweiser's quality of excellence. Rather, the fellow admitted that the material is boring that they are taught so the tour guides get together and decide to skip a lot of it to tell jokes. The gal, I think her name was Casey, if English wasn't my first language I would have understood none of her rote, monotone, bored, restless delivery. I asked her to slow down and she did so temporarily and resentfully. I came to learn about the brewing process at Budweiser and left very disappointed. I would recommend performance training, development of communication skills, and the ability to read their audience and a deeper knowledge of the company to answer questions. They should dress professionally rather than in cut off shorts and tee shirts. If you would like to know more about my experience, I would be pleased to speak with one of your representatives. ",1
13163,Great tour,10
14895,"Beer master tour was fun, plus the sampling of the fresh beer was great.",10

18089,The friendly staff ,10
13047,Great tour guy (Andrew) for the BrewMaster Tour. Good customer service at picture booth and gift shop.,10
13110,The Tour was exactly as advertised. The only suggestion would be to help the guides know when certain aspects of the plant are in operation or not. Some of the tour experience is to watch things in motion and not just the historical aspect of things. Great overall!,10
13135,,10
16421,Was a great tour. Guide was very knowledgeable,10
13315,The history that the guides told plus the history that the buildings and grounds told ,10
13157,Very informative,10
13955,We always have a great time on this tour. The leaders are great and it's a fun time.,10
12860,"I purchased tickets for the beer school the day before. When our schedule changed, I called to reschedule and was able to do so without any trouble. The woman who I spoke with was very helpful and kind. My instructor for beer school was also very kind and knowledgeable. Every employee we interacted with (also in the Biergarten, complementary tour, info desk, etc) was wonderful. ",10
12941,"Unfortunately the hosts and almost everyone we interacted with were not very friendly or hospitable. I'm from St Louis and have been to the brewery many times over the years, to bring out of town guests. I sincerely hope that management will take note of this review and consider a more active role. The young staff members we met all spoke under their breath to coworkers instead of to guests, and generally make it clear that the guests on the tour were a hassle.  AB is fighting for every loyal drinker in this day of craft beer. The guests at your brewery are the most likely candidates for loyal customers. I'd suggest that some coaching on hospitality is needed. These tours used to leave my friends awestruck and this time I was honestly embarrassed.  The brewery is beautiful and has an amazing history. ",3
13006,The best tour I have ever been on. And the beer. Oh the beer!,10
13045,Always a fun experience learn something new each time,10

13212,"Tour guides delivered a fun and informative tour.  The facility is both beautiful and a marvel of engineering.  Everyone working here was hospitable.  Then you throw in a little free beer and a great meal at the Biergarten, and it is all enjoyable and memorable.  It is a highlight in our week in St. Louis.",10
14057,Our tour guide was vey knowledgeable and made the tour fun. ,10
13032,Staff was friendly,10
13008,You pretty much get $10 of beer on the way and it's an awesome tour too. ,10
15199,Every one AB was great Thank you  Dennis Petersen .Love Bud Light,10
13528,Great tour! Wish they had a gluten free option during the tastings but got to enjoy one at the end. We also had hoped to be able to get closer to the horses BUT luckily we were able to when we left as they were hitching up on of the teams! Great memory!! ,10
16377,king of beers,10
16130,The fact that the tour included facilities that are behind the scenes and perhaps of a sensitive nature was of great interest to me. I found the history of all the buildings fascinating and the fact that they continue to stand and house all the modern technology very refreshing. That you did not just demolish and build new is very impressive. You obviously are focused on your roots and history. The samples of the beer on my tour were a nice touch. The young lady who was our tour guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. She answered all our questions and was a pleasure to listen to. I enjoyed myself very much and have a knew admiration for Budweiser. Cheers!   ,10
13154,"It was a lot of fun and the gifts (hat, beer, etc) were a real treat. ",10
13003,Awesome!!,10

15075,Great tour! Very knowledgeable and friendly staff!!! Great that you cater to young people as well as it was our family vacation.,10
13909,We thought the information would include more history.  The little bit we got was interesting.  ,7
14045,Very informative and great history,10
13237,I was disappointed with the tour.  I have been on much better ones.  I was in a group of five and we could not understand what the guides were saying in many of the stops.  The girls were much easier to understand then the boys.  I really didn't learn much about the beer process.   We only got to see the rear end of the horses and no dogs.  The five of us were really looking forward to the tour and did not mind paying $11 but after the tour we were disappointed.  Your grounds and buildings were the best part of the day.,6
13241,Our guide was very fun and knowledgeable. We enjoyed the tour and all the beautiful sites!,10

14621,"We toured on 7/15 at 1:50pm with Tim.  Anheuser-Busch has something special in Tim-- He's clearly very passionate about AB and their products, as well as the history of the company and beer in general.  He really made our tour awesome!  We were very surprised to hear he had only been with AB since last March.  We have already started recommending the beermaster tour to everyone we know!",10

18269,Fortune was a great tour guide.  The level of detail on the brewing process was good for our level of interest.,10

14600,"I was looking forward to this day fresh tour but it ended up raining. I felt like we didn't get to make the most of the tour and couldn't see anything. We only saw the inside stables, how its brewed, and the production line. Then just the trolly back to the biergarden. I understand that it was the rains fault, but I thought the tour guide would have made up for it. the 75 minute tour wasn't 75 minutes and mostly consisted of standing around waiting for the rain. When I went back up to get a second sample since we were stranded, I was told we were allowed only one. Maybe when it rains and people can't do much and are waiting around, you guys should compensate them with a few extra samples since they aren't getting as much out of the tour. Thanks and I plan to come back when (hopefully) its not raining!",6
15037,Our guides were excellent .  We enjoyed the experience,10
14366,"I was soooooo full upon leaving.  It was just too much beer with too much food.  I took at least half, maybe more of my dinner home, but I guess it was the beer that was so filling.  I was really miserable afterwards.  I enjoyed what I heard from the asst. brewmaster and chef, but is wasn't easy to hear them.  There was a lot of background noise.  I would be more interested if the portions of beer and food were smaller with a lesser price also.  Everyone associated at the brewery was very nice!",5
13395,"I brought friends to their first visit.  I've been many times.  We did the day fresh tour, 2:10 on July 7.  I really felt the tour was rushed.  No mention of the history at the beginning of the tour and tour guides did not speak loud or share as much information as I'd been on in the past.  My friends enjoyed, I was disappointed as it was not to the level of previous tours.  I will still always recommend folks visit.",8

14103,"It is a fun, educational experience.  I love the history and the stories.  The grounds and brewery are immaculate.  ",10
16117,The headsets were not working making it difficult to hear the tour guide.  There were a lot of people at the brewery that day and it caused the regular tour groups and the brew master tour groups to be in the same locations at times causing it difficult to hear our tour guide.  The tour took longer than in the past so at the end we did not get to spend much time in the room to enjoy the available refreshments.  I felt the tour was overpriced for what we got to experience that day.,5

Two disappointments  He bought an iPhone cover and did not open it until we got back.  his iPhone was too big.  He is 17 years old and wanted to impress his friends when he got back to Milan.  Sad face. The other disappointments was that whenever I have visited, the groomers lead out one of the horses and brushed it while the tour got to watch.  it is so thrilling to see one of those big guys in the center of the room rather than back behind stalls doors and roped off area.  Nevertheless, the  Brewery experience  is still on the top of our list!  Thanks, Kay Kiernan",10

21667,Andrew was very knowledgeable and friendly. The facility was impressively clean! The price was right on as well. The food in the restaurant was really good and reasonably priced. The Clydesdales are fantastic and it was an honor to be so close to such a magnificent animal. I would only suggest one thing..... you need club head covers (for golf) in the gift shop! A Clydesdale for the driver and bud covers for the rest. I would have bought those in a minute! Otherwise we loved our day with your staff. A+++ ,10

At the end of our tour which concluded in the bottling building, we were told a trolley would come to pick up our tour group so that we wouldn't have to walk back up the hill (in 104 heat) to the beer garden. Our group waited at least 20 minutes for the trolley to never pick us up. As a group, our tour guide had us make the walk which was physically difficult for many individuals in our party. What was even more frustrating was that neither of our tour guides, young women, had either of their walkie-talkies so they were unable to communicate with other staff members to call for the trolley.
